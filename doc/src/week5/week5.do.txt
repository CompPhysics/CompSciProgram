===== Fine-tuning neural network hyperparameters =====

The flexibility of neural networks is also one of their main
drawbacks: there are many hyperparameters to tweak. Not only can you
use any imaginable network topology (how neurons/nodes are interconnected),
but even in a simple FFNN you can change the number of layers, the
number of neurons per layer, the type of activation function to use in
each layer, the weight initialization logic, the stochastic gradient optmized and much more. How do you
know what combination of hyperparameters is the best for your task?

* You can use grid search with cross-validation to find the right hyperparameters.

However,since there are many hyperparameters to tune, and since
training a neural network on a large dataset takes a lot of time, you
will only be able to explore a tiny part of the hyperparameter space.


* You can use randomized search.
* Or use tools like "Oscar":"http://oscar.calldesk.ai/", which implements more complex algorithms to help you find a good set of hyperparameters quickly.  

!split
===== Hidden layers =====



For many problems you can start with just one or two hidden layers and it will work just fine.
For the MNIST data set you ca easily get a high accuracy using just one hidden layer with a
few hundred neurons.
You can reach for this data set above 98% accuracy using two hidden layers with the same total amount of
neurons, in roughly the same amount of training time. 

For more complex problems, you can gradually
ramp up the number of hidden layers, until you start overfitting the training set. Very complex tasks, such
as large image classification or speech recognition, typically require networks with dozens of layers
and they need a huge amount
of training data. However, you will rarely have to train such networks from scratch: it is much more
common to reuse parts of a pretrained state-of-the-art network that performs a similar task.




!split 
===== Which activation function should I use? =====

The Back propagation algorithm we derived above works by going from
the output layer to the input layer, propagating the error gradient on
the way. Once the algorithm has computed the gradient of the cost
function with regards to each parameter in the network, it uses these
gradients to update each parameter with a Gradient Descent (GD) step.


Unfortunately for us, the gradients often get smaller and smaller as the
algorithm progresses down to the first hidden layers. As a result, the
GD update leaves the lower layer connection weights
virtually unchanged, and training never converges to a good
solution. This is known in the literature as 
_the vanishing gradients problem_. 

In other cases, the opposite can happen, namely the the gradients can grow bigger and
bigger. The result is that many of the layers get large updates of the 
weights the
algorithm diverges. This is the _exploding gradients problem_, which is
mostly encountered in recurrent neural networks. More generally, deep
neural networks suffer from unstable gradients, different layers may
learn at widely different speeds



!split 
===== Is the Logistic activation function (Sigmoid)  our choice? =====

Although this unfortunate behavior has been empirically observed for
quite a while (it was one of the reasons why deep neural networks were
mostly abandoned for a long time), it is only around 2010 that
significant progress was made in understanding it.

A paper titled "Understanding the Difficulty of Training Deep
Feedforward Neural Networks by Xavier Glorot and Yoshua Bengio":"http://proceedings.mlr.press/v9/glorot10a.html" found that
the problems with the popular logistic
sigmoid activation function and the weight initialization technique
that was most popular at the time, namely random initialization using
a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of
1. 

They showed that with this activation function and this
initialization scheme, the variance of the outputs of each layer is
much greater than the variance of its inputs. Going forward in the
network, the variance keeps increasing after each layer until the
activation function saturates at the top layers. This is actually made
worse by the fact that the logistic function has a mean of 0.5, not 0
(the hyperbolic tangent function has a mean of 0 and behaves slightly
better than the logistic function in deep networks).


!split
===== The derivative of the Logistic funtion =====

Looking at the logistic activation function, when inputs become large
(negative or positive), the function saturates at 0 or 1, with a
derivative extremely close to 0. Thus when backpropagation kicks in,
it has virtually no gradient to propagate back through the network,
and what little gradient exists keeps getting diluted as
backpropagation progresses down through the top layers, so there is
really nothing left for the lower layers.

In their paper, Glorot and Bengio propose a way to significantly
alleviate this problem. We need the signal to flow properly in both
directions: in the forward direction when making predictions, and in
the reverse direction when backpropagating gradients. We don’t want
the signal to die out, nor do we want it to explode and saturate. For
the signal to flow properly, the authors argue that we need the
variance of the outputs of each layer to be equal to the variance of
its inputs, and we also need the gradients to have equal variance
before and after flowing through a layer in the reverse direction.



One of the insights in the 2010 paper by Glorot and Bengio was that
the vanishing/exploding gradients problems were in part due to a poor
choice of activation function. Until then most people had assumed that
if Nature had chosen to use roughly sigmoid activation functions in
biological neurons, they must be an excellent choice. But it turns out
that other activation functions behave much better in deep neural
networks, in particular the ReLU activation function, mostly because
it does not saturate for positive values (and also because it is quite
fast to compute).


!split
===== The RELU function family =====

The ReLU activation function suffers from a problem known as the dying
ReLUs: during training, some neurons effectively die, meaning they
stop outputting anything other than 0.

In some cases, you may find that half of your network’s neurons are
dead, especially if you used a large learning rate. During training,
if a neuron’s weights get updated such that the weighted sum of the
neuron’s inputs is negative, it will start outputting 0. When this
happen, the neuron is unlikely to come back to life since the gradient
of the ReLU function is 0 when its input is negative.

To solve this problem, nowadays practitioners use a  variant of the ReLU
function, such as the leaky ReLU discussed above or the so-called
exponential linear unit (ELU) function


!bt
\[
ELU(z) = \left\{\begin{array}{cc} \alpha\left( \exp{(z)}-1\right) & z < 0,\\  z & z \ge 0.\end{array}\right. 
\]
!et

!split
===== Which activation function should we use? =====

In general it seems that the ELU activation function is better than
the leaky ReLU function (and its variants), which is better than
ReLU. ReLU performs better than $\tanh$ which in turn performs better
than the logistic function. 

If runtime
performance is an issue, then you may opt for the  leaky ReLU function  over the 
ELU function If you don’t
want to tweak yet another hyperparameter, you may just use the default
$\alpha$ of $0.01$ for the leaky ReLU, and $1$ for ELU. If you have
spare time and computing power, you can use cross-validation or
bootstrap to evaluate other activation functions.


!split
=====  More on activation functions, output layers =====

In most cases you can use the ReLU activation function in the hidden layers (or one of its variants).

It is a bit faster to compute than other activation functions, and the gradient descent optimization does in general not get stuck.

_For the output layer:_

* For classification the softmax activation function is generally a good choice for classification tasks (when the classes are mutually exclusive).
* For regression tasks, you can simply use no activation function at all.




!split
===== Batch Normalization =====

Batch Normalization
aims to address the vanishing/exploding gradients problems, and more generally the problem that the
distribution of each layer’s inputs changes during training, as the parameters of the previous layers change.

The technique consists of adding an operation in the model just before the activation function of each
layer, simply zero-centering and normalizing the inputs, then scaling and shifting the result using two new
parameters per layer (one for scaling, the other for shifting). In other words, this operation lets the model
learn the optimal scale and mean of the inputs for each layer.
In order to zero-center and normalize the inputs, the algorithm needs to estimate the inputs’ mean and
standard deviation. It does so by evaluating the mean and standard deviation of the inputs over the current
mini-batch, from this the name batch normalization.

!split
===== Dropout =====

It is a fairly simple algorithm: at every training step, every neuron (including the input neurons but
excluding the output neurons) has a probability $p$ of being temporarily dropped out, meaning it will be
entirely ignored during this training step, but it may be active during the next step.

The
hyperparameter $p$ is called the dropout rate, and it is typically set to 50%. After training, the neurons are not dropped anymore.
 It is viewed as one of the most popular regularization techniques.

!split
===== Gradient Clipping =====

A popular technique to lessen the exploding gradients problem is to simply clip the gradients during
backpropagation so that they never exceed some threshold (this is mostly useful for recurrent neural
networks).

This technique is called Gradient Clipping.

In general however, Batch
Normalization is preferred.

Thx a million to Ghadi for sharing. 

!split 
===== A top-down perspective on Neural networks =====


The first thing we would like to do is divide the data into two or three
parts. A training set, a validation or dev (development) set, and a
test set. The test set is the data on which we want to make
predictions. The dev set is a subset of the training data we use to
check how well we are doing out-of-sample, after training the model on
the training dataset. We use the validation error as a proxy for the
test error in order to make tweaks to our model. It is crucial that we
do not use any of the test data to train the algorithm. This is a
cardinal sin in ML. Then:

 
* Estimate optimal error rate

* Minimize underfitting (bias) on training data set.

* Make sure you are not overfitting.

If the validation and test sets are drawn from the same distributions,
then a good performance on the validation set should lead to similarly
good performance on the test set. 

However, sometimes
the training data and test data differ in subtle ways because, for
example, they are collected using slightly different methods, or
because it is cheaper to collect data in one way versus another. In
this case, there can be a mismatch between the training and test
data. This can lead to the neural network overfitting these small
differences between the test and training sets, and a poor performance
on the test set despite having a good performance on the validation
set. To rectify this, Andrew Ng suggests making two validation or dev
sets, one constructed from the training data and one constructed from
the test data. The difference between the performance of the algorithm
on these two validation sets quantifies the train-test mismatch. This
can serve as another important diagnostic when using DNNs for
supervised learning.

!split
===== Limitations of supervised learning with deep networks =====

Like all statistical methods, supervised learning using neural
networks has important limitations. This is especially important when
one seeks to apply these methods, especially to physics problems. Like
all tools, DNNs are not a universal solution. Often, the same or
better performance on a task can be achieved by using a few
hand-engineered features (or even a collection of random
features). 

Here we list some of the important limitations of supervised neural network based models. 



* _Need labeled data_. All supervised learning methods, DNNs for supervised learning require labeled data. Often, labeled data is harder to acquire than unlabeled data (e.g. one must pay for human experts to label images).
* _Supervised neural networks are extremely data intensive._ DNNs are data hungry. They perform best when data is plentiful. This is doubly so for supervised methods where the data must also be labeled. The utility of DNNs is extremely limited if data is hard to acquire or the datasets are small (hundreds to a few thousand samples). In this case, the performance of other methods that utilize hand-engineered features can exceed that of DNNs.
* _Homogeneous data._ Almost all DNNs deal with homogeneous data of one type. It is very hard to design architectures that mix and match data types (i.e.~some continuous variables, some discrete variables, some time series). In applications beyond images, video, and language, this is often what is required. In contrast, ensemble models like random forests or gradient-boosted trees have no difficulty handling mixed data types.
* _Many problems are not about prediction._ In natural science we are often interested in learning something about the underlying distribution that generates the data. In this case, it is often difficult to cast these ideas in a supervised learning setting. While the problems are related, it is possible to make good predictions with a *wrong* model. The model might or might not be useful for understanding the underlying science.

Some of these remarks are particular to DNNs, others are shared by all supervised learning methods. This motivates the use of unsupervised methods which in part circumvent these problems.

=====  Reminder on the solution of ordinary and partial differential equations =====
For ordinary differential equations, see for example the lectures at URL:"http://compphysics.github.io/ComputationalPhysics/doc/pub/ode/html/ode-reveal.html".

After the discussion of ordinary differential equations, we will give a brief review of partial differential equations (see below).

!split
===== Ordinary Differential Equations =====

An ordinary differential equation (ODE) is an equation involving functions having one variable.

In general, an ordinary differential equation looks like

!bt
\begin{equation} \label{ode}
f\left(x, \, g(x), \, g'(x), \, g''(x), \, \dots \, , \, g^{(n)}(x)\right) = 0
\end{equation}
!et

where $g(x)$ is the function to find, and $g^{(n)}(x)$ is the $n$-th derivative of $g(x)$.

The $f\left(x, g(x), g'(x), g''(x), \, \dots \, , g^{(n)}(x)\right)$ is just a way to write that there is an expression involving $x$ and $g(x), \ g'(x), \ g''(x), \, \dots \, , \text{ and } g^{(n)}(x)$ on the left side of the equality sign in (ref{ode}).
The highest order of derivative, that is the value of $n$, determines to the order of the equation.
The equation is referred to as a $n$-th order ODE.
Along with (ref{ode}), some additional conditions of the function $g(x)$ are typically given
for the solution to be unique.

!split
===== The trial solution =====

Let the trial solution $g_t(x)$ be

!bt
\begin{equation}
	g_t(x) = h_1(x) + h_2(x,N(x,P))
\end{equation}
!et


where $h_1(x)$ is a function that makes $g_t(x)$ satisfy a given set
of conditions, $N(x,P)$ a neural network with weights and biases
described by $P$ and $h_2(x, N(x,P))$ some expression involving the
neural network.  The role of the function $h_2(x, N(x,P))$, is to
ensure that the output from $N(x,P)$ is zero when $g_t(x)$ is
evaluated at the values of $x$ where the given conditions must be
satisfied.  The function $h_1(x)$ should alone make $g_t(x)$ satisfy
the conditions.

But what about the network $N(x,P)$?


As described previously, an optimization method could be used to minimize the parameters of a neural network, that being its weights and biases, through backward propagation.


!split
===== Minimization process =====

For the minimization to be defined, we need to have a cost function at hand to minimize.

It is given that $f\left(x, \, g(x), \, g'(x), \, g''(x), \, \dots \, , \, g^{(n)}(x)\right)$ should be equal to zero in (ref{ode}).
We can choose to consider the mean squared error as the cost function for an input $x$.
Since we are looking at one input, the cost function is just $f$ squared.
The cost function $c\left(x, P \right)$ can therefore be expressed as

!bt
C\left(x, P\right) = \big(f\left(x, \, g(x), \, g'(x), \, g''(x), \, \dots \, , \, g^{(n)}(x)\right)\big)^2
!et

If $N$ inputs are given as a vector $\bm{x}$ with elements $x_i$ for $i = 1,\dots,N$,
the cost function becomes

!bt
\begin{equation} \label{cost}
	C\left(\bm{x}, P\right) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \big(f\left(x_i, \, g(x_i), \, g'(x_i), \, g''(x_i), \, \dots \, , \, g^{(n)}(x_i)\right)\big)^2
\end{equation}
!et

The neural net should then find the parameters $P$ that minimizes the cost function in
(ref{cost}) for a set of $N$ training samples $x_i$.

!split
===== Minimizing the cost function using gradient descent and automatic differentiation =====

To perform the minimization using gradient descent, the gradient of $C\left(\bm{x}, P\right)$ is needed.
It might happen so that finding an analytical expression of the gradient of $C(\bm{x}, P)$ from (ref{cost}) gets too messy, depending on which cost function one desires to use.

Luckily, there exists libraries that makes the job for us through automatic differentiation.
Automatic differentiation is a method of finding the derivatives numerically with very high precision.


!split
===== Example: Exponential decay =====

An exponential decay of a quantity $g(x)$ is described by the equation

!bt
\begin{equation} \label{solve_expdec}
  g'(x) = -\gamma g(x)
\end{equation}
!et

with $g(0) = g_0$ for some chosen initial value $g_0$.

The analytical solution of (ref{solve_expdec}) is

!bt
\begin{equation}
  g(x) = g_0 \exp\left(-\gamma x\right)
\end{equation}
!et

Having an analytical solution at hand, it is possible to use it to compare how well a neural network finds a solution of (ref{solve_expdec}).


!split
===== The function to solve for =====

The program will use a neural network to solve

!bt
\begin{equation} \label{solveode}
g'(x) = -\gamma g(x)
\end{equation}
!et

where $g(0) = g_0$ with $\gamma$ and $g_0$ being some chosen values.

In this example, $\gamma = 2$ and $g_0 = 10$.

!split
===== The trial solution =====
To begin with, a trial solution $g_t(t)$ must be chosen. A general trial solution for ordinary differential equations could be

!bt
g_t(x, P) = h_1(x) + h_2(x, N(x, P))
!et

with $h_1(x)$ ensuring that $g_t(x)$ satisfies some conditions and $h_2(x,N(x, P))$ an expression involving $x$ and the output from the neural network $N(x,P)$ with $P $ being the collection of the weights and biases for each layer. For now, it is assumed that the network consists of one input layer, one hidden layer, and one output layer.

!split
===== Setup of Network =====

In this network, there are no weights and bias at the input layer, so $P = \{ P_{\text{hidden}},  P_{\text{output}} \}$.
If there are $N_{\text{hidden} }$ neurons in the hidden layer, then $P_{\text{hidden}}$ is a $N_{\text{hidden} } \times (1 + N_{\text{input}})$ matrix, given that there are $N_{\text{input}}$ neurons in the input layer.

The first column in $P_{\text{hidden} }$ represents the bias for each neuron in the hidden layer and the second column represents the weights for each neuron in the hidden layer from the input layer.
If there are $N_{\text{output} }$ neurons in the output layer, then $P_{\text{output}} $ is a $N_{\text{output} } \times (1 + N_{\text{hidden} })$ matrix.

Its first column represents the bias of each neuron and the remaining columns represents the weights to each neuron.

It is given that $g(0) = g_0$. The trial solution must fulfill this condition to be a proper solution of (ref{solveode}). A possible way to ensure that $g_t(0, P) = g_0$, is to let $F(N(x,P)) = x \cdot N(x,P)$ and $A(x) = g_0$. This gives the following trial solution:

!bt
\begin{equation} \label{trial}
g_t(x, P) = g_0 + x \cdot N(x, P)
\end{equation}
!et

!split
===== Reformulating the problem =====

We wish that our neural network manages to minimize a given cost function.

A reformulation of out equation, (ref{solveode}), must therefore be done,
such that it describes the problem a neural network can solve for.

The neural network must find the set of weights and biases $P$ such that the trial solution in (ref{trial}) satisfies (ref{solveode}).

The trial solution

!bt
g_t(x, P) = g_0 + x \cdot N(x, P)
!et

has been chosen such that it already solves the condition $g(0) = g_0$. What remains, is to find $P$ such that

!bt
\begin{equation} \label{nnmin}
g_t'(x, P) = - \gamma g_t(x, P)
\end{equation}
!et

is fulfilled as *best as possible*.

!split
===== More technicalities =====

The left hand side and right hand side of (ref{nnmin}) must be computed separately, and then the neural network must choose weights and biases, contained in $P$, such that the sides are equal as best as possible.
This means that the absolute or squared difference between the sides must be as close to zero, ideally equal to zero.
In this case, the difference squared shows to be an appropriate measurement of how erroneous the trial solution is with respect to $P$ of the neural network.

This gives the following cost function our neural network must solve for:

!bt
\min_{P}\Big\{ \big(g_t'(x, P) - ( -\gamma g_t(x, P) \big)^2 \Big\}
!et

(the notation $\min_{P}\{ f(x, P) \}$ means that we desire to find $P$ that yields the minimum of $f(x, P)$)

or, in terms of weights and biases for the hidden and output layer in our network:

!bt
\min_{P_{\text{hidden} }, \ P_{\text{output} }}\Big\{ \big(g_t'(x, \{ P_{\text{hidden} }, P_{\text{output} }\}) - ( -\gamma g_t(x, \{ P_{\text{hidden} }, P_{\text{output} }\}) \big)^2 \Big\}
!et

for an input value $x$.

!split
=====  More details =====

If the neural network evaluates $g_t(x, P)$ at more values for $x$, say $N$ values $x_i$ for $i = 1, \dots, N$, then the *total* error to minimize becomes

!bt
\begin{equation} \label{min}
\min_{P}\Big\{\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N  \big(g_t'(x_i, P) - ( -\gamma g_t(x_i, P) \big)^2 \Big\}
\end{equation}
!et

Letting $\bm{x}$ be a vector with elements $x_i$ and $C(\bm{x}, P) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_i  \big(g_t'(x_i, P) - ( -\gamma g_t(x_i, P) \big)^2$ denote the cost function, the minimization problem that our network must solve, becomes

!bt
\min_{P} C(\bm{x}, P)
!et

In terms of $P_{\text{hidden} }$ and $P_{\text{output} }$, this could also be expressed as

$$
\min_{P_{\text{hidden} }, \ P_{\text{output} }} C(\bm{x}, \{P_{\text{hidden} }, P_{\text{output} }\})
$$

!split
===== A possible implementation of a neural network =====

For simplicity, it is assumed that the input is an array $\bm{x} = (x_1, \dots, x_N)$ with $N$ elements. It is at these points the neural network should find $P$ such that it fulfills (ref{min}).

First, the neural network must feed forward the inputs.
This means that $\bm{x}s$ must be passed through an input layer, a hidden layer and a output layer. The input layer in this case, does not need to process the data any further.
The input layer will consist of $N_{\text{input} }$ neurons, passing its element to each neuron in the hidden layer.  The number of neurons in the hidden layer will be $N_{\text{hidden} }$.

!split
===== Technicalities =====

For the $i$-th in the hidden layer with weight $w_i^{\text{hidden} }$ and bias $b_i^{\text{hidden} }$, the weighting from the $j$-th neuron at the input layer is:

!bt
\begin{aligned}
z_{i,j}^{\text{hidden}} &= b_i^{\text{hidden}} + w_i^{\text{hidden}}x_j \\
&=
\begin{pmatrix}
b_i^{\text{hidden}} & w_i^{\text{hidden}}
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
1 \\
x_j
\end{pmatrix}
\end{aligned}
!et

!split
=====  Final technicalities I =====

The result after weighting the inputs at the $i$-th hidden neuron can be written as a vector:

!bt
\begin{aligned}
\bm{z}_{i}^{\text{hidden}} &= \Big( b_i^{\text{hidden}} + w_i^{\text{hidden}}x_1 , \ b_i^{\text{hidden}} + w_i^{\text{hidden}} x_2, \ \dots \, , \ b_i^{\text{hidden}} + w_i^{\text{hidden}} x_N\Big)  \\
&=
\begin{pmatrix}
 b_i^{\text{hidden}}  & w_i^{\text{hidden}}
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
1  & 1 & \dots & 1 \\
x_1 & x_2 & \dots & x_N
\end{pmatrix} \\
&= \bm{p}_{i, \text{hidden}}^T X
\end{aligned}
!et

!split
=====  Final technicalities II =====

The vector $\bm{p}_{i, \text{hidden}}^T$ constitutes each row in $P_{\text{hidden} }$, which contains the weights for the neural network to minimize according to (ref{min}).

After having found $\bm{z}_{i}^{\text{hidden}} $ for every $i$-th neuron within the hidden layer, the vector will be sent to an activation function $a_i(\bm{z})$.

In this example, the sigmoid function has been chosen to be the activation function for each hidden neuron:

!bt
f(z) = \frac{1}{1 + \exp{(-z)}}
!et

It is possible to use other activations functions for the hidden layer also.

The output $\bm{x}_i^{\text{hidden}}$ from each $i$-th hidden neuron is:

$$
\bm{x}_i^{\text{hidden} } = f\big(  \bm{z}_{i}^{\text{hidden}} \big)
$$

The outputs $\bm{x}_i^{\text{hidden} } $ are then sent to the output layer.

The output layer consists of one neuron in this case, and combines the
output from each of the neurons in the hidden layers. The output layer
combines the results from the hidden layer using some weights $w_i^{\text{output}}$
and biases $b_i^{\text{output}}$. In this case,
it is assumes that the number of neurons in the output layer is one.

!split
=====  Final technicalities III =====


The procedure of weighting the output neuron $j$ in the hidden layer to the $i$-th neuron in the output layer is similar as for the hidden layer described previously.

!bt
\begin{aligned}
z_{1,j}^{\text{output}} & =
\begin{pmatrix}
b_1^{\text{output}} & \bm{w}_1^{\text{output}}
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
1 \\
\bm{x}_j^{\text{hidden}}
\end{pmatrix}
\end{aligned}
!et

!split
=====  Final technicalities IV =====

Expressing $z_{1,j}^{\text{output}}$ as a vector gives the following way of weighting the inputs from the hidden layer:

!bt
\bm{z}_{1}^{\text{output}} =
\begin{pmatrix}
b_1^{\text{output}} & \bm{w}_1^{\text{output}}
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
1  & 1 & \dots & 1 \\
\bm{x}_1^{\text{hidden}} & \bm{x}_2^{\text{hidden}} & \dots & \bm{x}_N^{\text{hidden}}
\end{pmatrix}
!et

In this case we seek a continuous range of values since we are approximating a function. This means that after computing $\bm{z}_{1}^{\text{output}}$ the neural network has finished its feed forward step, and $\bm{z}_{1}^{\text{output}}$ is the final output of the network.

!split
===== Back propagation =====

The next step is to decide how the parameters should be changed such that they minimize the cost function.

The chosen cost function for this problem is

!bt
C(\bm{x}, P) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_i  \big(g_t'(x_i, P) - ( -\gamma g_t(x_i, P) \big)^2
!et

In order to minimize the cost function, an optimization method must be chosen.

Here, gradient descent with a constant step size has been chosen.

!split
===== Gradient descent =====

The idea of the gradient descent algorithm is to update parameters in
a direction where the cost function decreases goes to a minimum.

In general, the update of some parameters $\bm{\omega}$ given a cost
function defined by some weights $\bm{\omega}$, $C(\bm{x},
\bm{\omega})$, goes as follows:

!bt
\bm{\omega}_{\text{new} } = \bm{\omega} - \lambda \nabla_{\bm{\omega}} C(\bm{x}, \bm{\omega})
!et

for a number of iterations or until $ \big|\big| \bm{\omega}_{\text{new} } - \bm{\omega} \big|\big|$ becomes smaller than some given tolerance.

The value of $\lambda$ decides how large steps the algorithm must take
in the direction of $ \nabla_{\bm{\omega}} C(\bm{x}, \bm{\omega})$.
The notation $\nabla_{\bm{\omega}}$ express the gradient with respect
to the elements in $\bm{\omega}$.

In our case, we have to minimize the cost function $C(\bm{x}, P)$ with
respect to the two sets of weights and biases, that is for the hidden
layer $P_{\text{hidden} }$ and for the output layer $P_{\text{output}
}$ .

This means that $P_{\text{hidden} }$ and $P_{\text{output} }$ is updated by

!bt
\begin{aligned}
P_{\text{hidden},\text{new}} &= P_{\text{hidden}} - \lambda \nabla_{P_{\text{hidden}}} C(\bm{x}, P)  \\
P_{\text{output},\text{new}} &= P_{\text{output}} - \lambda \nabla_{P_{\text{output}}} C(\bm{x}, P)
\end{aligned}

===== Example: Population growth =====

A logistic model of population growth assumes that a population converges toward an equilibrium.
The population growth can be modeled by

!bt
\begin{equation} \label{log}
	g'(t) = \alpha g(t)(A - g(t))
\end{equation}
!et

where $g(t)$ is the population density at time $t$, $\alpha > 0$ the growth rate and $A > 0$ is the maximum population number in the environment.
Also, at $t = 0$ the population has the size $g(0) = g_0$, where $g_0$ is some chosen constant.

In this example, similar network as for the exponential decay using Autograd has been used to solve the equation. However, as the implementation might suffer from e.g numerical instability
and high execution time (this might be more apparent in the examples solving PDEs),
using a library like  TensorFlow is recommended.
Here, we stay with a more simple approach and implement for comparison, the simple forward Euler method.

!split
===== Setting up the problem =====

Here, we will model a population $g(t)$ in an environment having carrying capacity $A$.
The population follows the model

!bt
\begin{equation} \label{solveode_population}
g'(t) = \alpha g(t)(A - g(t))
\end{equation}
!et

where $g(0) = g_0$.

In this example, we let $\alpha = 2$, $A = 1$, and $g_0 = 1.2$.

!split
===== The trial solution =====

We will get a slightly different trial solution, as the boundary conditions are different
compared to the case for exponential decay.

A possible trial solution satisfying the condition $g(0) = g_0$ could be

$$
h_1(t) = g_0 + t \cdot N(t,P)
$$

with $N(t,P)$ being the output from the neural network with weights and biases for each layer collected in the set $P$.

The analytical solution is

$$
g(t) = \frac{Ag_0}{g_0 + (A - g_0)\exp(-\alpha A t)}
$$

===== Using forward Euler to solve the ODE =====

A straightforward way of solving an ODE numerically, is to use Euler's method.

Euler's method uses Taylor series to approximate the value at a function $f$ at a step $\Delta x$ from $x$:

$$
f(x + \Delta x) \approx f(x) + \Delta x f'(x)
$$

In our case, using Euler's method to approximate the value of $g$ at a step $\Delta t$ from $t$ yields

!bt
\begin{aligned}
  g(t + \Delta t) &\approx g(t) + \Delta t g'(t) \\
  &= g(t) + \Delta t \big(\alpha g(t)(A - g(t))\big)
\end{aligned}
!et
along with the condition that $g(0) = g_0$.

Let $t_i = i \cdot \Delta t$ where $\Delta t = \frac{T}{N_t-1}$ where $T$ is the final time our solver must solve for and $N_t$ the number of values for $t \in [0, T]$ for $i = 0, \dots, N_t-1$.

For $i \geq 1$, we have that
!bt
\begin{aligned}
t_i &= i\Delta t \\
&= (i - 1)\Delta t + \Delta t \\
&= t_{i-1} + \Delta t
\end{aligned}
!et

Now, if $g_i = g(t_i)$ then

!bt
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
  g_i &= g(t_i) \\
  &= g(t_{i-1} + \Delta t) \\
  &\approx g(t_{i-1}) + \Delta t \big(\alpha g(t_{i-1})(A - g(t_{i-1}))\big) \\
  &= g_{i-1} + \Delta t \big(\alpha g_{i-1}(A - g_{i-1})\big)
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation} \label{odenum}
!et
for $i \geq 1$ and $g_0 = g(t_0) = g(0) = g_0$.

Equation (ref{odenum}) could be implemented in the following way,
extending the program that uses the network using Autograd:

===== Example: Solving the one dimensional Poisson equation =====

The Poisson equation for $g(x)$ in one dimension is

!bt
\begin{equation} \label{poisson}
  -g''(x) = f(x)
\end{equation}
!et

where $f(x)$ is a given function for $x \in (0,1)$.

The conditions that $g(x)$ is chosen to fulfill, are
!bt
\begin{align*}
  g(0) &= 0 \\
  g(1) &= 0
\end{align*}
!et

This equation can be solved numerically using programs where e.g Autograd and TensorFlow are used.
The results from the networks can then be compared to the analytical solution.
In addition, it could be interesting to see how a typical method for numerically solving second order ODEs compares to the neural networks.

!split
===== The specific equation to solve for =====

Here, the function $g(x)$ to solve for follows the equation

!bt
-g''(x) = f(x),\qquad x \in (0,1)
!et

where $f(x)$ is a given function, along with the chosen conditions

!bt
\begin{aligned}
g(0) = g(1) = 0
\end{aligned}\label{cond}
!et

In this example, we consider the case when $f(x) = (3x + x^2)\exp(x)$.

For this case, a possible trial solution satisfying the conditions could be

!bt
g_t(x) = x \cdot (1-x) \cdot N(P,x)
!et

The analytical solution for this problem is

!bt
g(x) = x(1 - x)\exp(x)

===== Comparing with a numerical scheme =====

The Poisson equation is possible to solve using Taylor series to approximate the second derivative.

Using Taylor series, the second derivative can be expressed as

$$
g''(x) = \frac{g(x + \Delta x) - 2g(x) + g(x-\Delta x)}{\Delta x^2} + E_{\Delta x}(x)
$$

where $\Delta x$ is a small step size and $E_{\Delta x}(x)$ being the error term.

Looking away from the error terms gives an approximation to the second derivative:

!bt
\begin{equation} \label{approx}
g''(x) \approx \frac{g(x + \Delta x) - 2g(x) + g(x-\Delta x)}{\Delta x^2}
\end{equation}
!et

If $x_i = i \Delta x = x_{i-1} + \Delta x$ and $g_i = g(x_i)$ for $i = 1,\dots N_x - 2$ with $N_x$ being the number of values for $x$, (ref{approx}) becomes

!bt
\begin{aligned}
g''(x_i) &\approx \frac{g(x_i + \Delta x) - 2g(x_i) + g(x_i -\Delta x)}{\Delta x^2} \\
&= \frac{g_{i+1} - 2g_i + g_{i-1}}{\Delta x^2}
\end{aligned}
!et

Since we know from our problem that

!bt
\begin{aligned}
-g''(x) &= f(x) \\
&= (3x + x^2)\exp(x)
\end{aligned}
!et

along with the conditions $g(0) = g(1) = 0$,
the following scheme can be used to find an approximate solution for $g(x)$ numerically:

!bt
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
  -\Big( \frac{g_{i+1} - 2g_i + g_{i-1}}{\Delta x^2} \Big) &= f(x_i) \\
  -g_{i+1} + 2g_i - g_{i-1} &= \Delta x^2 f(x_i)
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation} \label{odesys}
!et

for $i = 1, \dots, N_x - 2$ where $g_0 = g_{N_x - 1} = 0$ and $f(x_i) = (3x_i + x_i^2)\exp(x_i)$, which is given for our specific problem.

The equation can be rewritten into a matrix equation:

!bt
\begin{aligned}
\begin{pmatrix}
2 & -1 & 0 & \dots & 0 \\
-1 & 2 & -1 & \dots & 0 \\
\vdots & & \ddots & & \vdots \\
0 & \dots & -1 & 2 & -1  \\
0 & \dots & 0 & -1 & 2\\
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
g_1 \\
g_2 \\
\vdots \\
g_{N_x - 3} \\
g_{N_x - 2}
\end{pmatrix}
&=
\Delta x^2
\begin{pmatrix}
f(x_1) \\
f(x_2) \\
\vdots \\
f(x_{N_x - 3}) \\
f(x_{N_x - 2})
\end{pmatrix} \\
\bm{A}\bm{g} &= \bm{f},
\end{aligned}
!et

which makes it possible to solve for the vector $\bm{g}$.

===== Partial Differential Equations =====

A partial differential equation (PDE) has a solution here the function
is defined by multiple variables.  The equation may involve all kinds
of combinations of which variables the function is differentiated with
respect to.

In general, a partial differential equation for a function $g(x_1,\dots,x_N)$ with $N$ variables may be expressed as

!bt
\begin{equation} \label{PDE}
  f\left(x_1, \, \dots \, , x_N, \frac{\partial g(x_1,\dots,x_N) }{\partial x_1}, \dots , \frac{\partial g(x_1,\dots,x_N) }{\partial x_N}, \frac{\partial g(x_1,\dots,x_N) }{\partial x_1\partial x_2}, \, \dots \, , \frac{\partial^n g(x_1,\dots,x_N) }{\partial x_N^n} \right) = 0
\end{equation}
!et

where $f$ is an expression involving all kinds of possible mixed derivatives of $g(x_1,\dots,x_N)$ up to an order $n$. In order for the solution to be unique, some additional conditions must also be given.


!split
===== Famous PDEs =====
In the Natural Sciences we often encounter problems with many variables
constrained by boundary conditions and initial values. Many of these problems
can be modelled as partial differential equations. One case which arises 
in many situations is the so-called wave equation whose one-dimensional form
reads
!bt
\begin{equation}
label{eq:waveeqpde}
 \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}=A\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2},
\end{equation}
!et
where $A$ is a constant. The solution $u$ depends on both spatial and temporal variables, viz. $u=u(x,t)$.


!split
===== Famous PDEs, two dimension =====
In two dimension we have $u=u(x,y,t)$.  We will, unless otherwise stated, simply use $u$ in our discussion below.
Familiar situations which this equation can model
are waves on a string, pressure waves, waves on the surface of a fjord or a 
lake, electromagnetic waves and sound waves to mention a few. For e.g., electromagnetic
waves we have the constant $A=c^2$, with $c$ the speed of light. It is rather
straightforward to extend this equation to two or three dimension. In two dimensions
we have
!bt
\begin{equation*}
 \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}+\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2}=A\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2},
\end{equation*}
!et


!split
===== Famous PDEs, diffusion equation =====
The diffusion equation whose one-dimensional version   reads

!bt
\begin{equation}
label{eq:diffusionpde}
 \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}=A\frac{\partial u}{\partial t},
\end{equation}
!et
and  $A$ is in this case called the diffusion constant. It can be used to model
a wide selection of diffusion processes, from molecules to the diffusion of heat
in a given material.

!split
===== Famous PDEs, Laplace's equation =====
Another familiar equation from electrostatics is Laplace's equation, which looks similar
to the wave equation in Eq. (ref{eq:waveeqpde}) except that we have set $A=0$

!bt
\begin{equation}
label{eq:laplacepde}
 \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}+\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2}=0,
\end{equation}
!et
or if we have a finite electric charge represented by a charge density 
$\rho(\mathbf{x})$ we have the familiar Poisson equation

!bt
\begin{equation}
label{eq:poissonpde}
 \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}+\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2}=-4\pi \rho(\mathbf{x}).
\end{equation}
!et

===== Famous PDEs, Helmholtz' equation =====
Other famous partial differential equations  are the Helmholtz (or eigenvalue) equation, here specialized to two 
dimensions only

!bt
\begin{equation}
label{eq:helmholtz}
 -\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}-\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2}=\lambda u,
\end{equation}
!et
the linear transport equation  (in $2+1$ dimensions) familiar from Brownian motion as well

\end{equation}

===== Famous PDEs, Maxwell's equations =====
Important systems of linear partial differential equations are the famous Maxwell equations

and
!bt
\[
-\mathrm{curl} \mathbf{E} =  \mathbf{B} 
\]
!et
and
!bt
\[
\mathrm{div} \mathbf{E} =   \mathrm{div}\mathbf{B}  = 0.
\]
!et

!split
===== Famous PDEs, Euler's equations =====
Similarly, famous systems of non-linear partial differential equations are for example Euler's equations for 
incompressible, inviscid flow
!bt
\begin{equation*}
 \frac{\partial \mathbf{u}}{\partial t} +\mathbf{u}\nabla\mathbf{u}=  -Dp; \hspace{1cm} \mathrm{div} \mathbf{u} =  0,
\end{equation*}
!et
with $p$ being the pressure and
!bt
\begin{equation*}
\nabla = \frac{\partial}{\partial x}e_x+\frac{\partial}{\partial y}e_y,
\end{equation*}
!et
in the two dimensions. The unit vectors are $e_x$ and $e_y$. 

!split
===== Famous PDEs, the Navier-Stokes' equations =====
Another example is the set of   
Navier-Stokes equations for incompressible, viscous flow

!bt
\begin{equation*}
 \frac{\partial \mathbf{u}}{\partial t} +\mathbf{u}\nabla\mathbf{u}-\Delta \mathbf{u}=  -Dp; \hspace{1cm} \mathrm{div} \mathbf{u} =  0.
\end{equation*}
!et


!split
===== Famous PDEs, general equation in two dimensions =====
A general partial differential equation with two given dimensions
reads

!bt
\begin{equation*}
A(x,y)\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}+B(x,y)\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x\partial y}
+C(x,y)\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2}=F(x,y,u,\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial u}{\partial y}),
\end{equation*}
!et
and if we set

!bt
\begin{equation*}
  B=C=0,
\end{equation*}
!et
we recover the $1+1$-dimensional diffusion equation which is an example
of a so-called parabolic partial differential equation.
With

!bt
\begin{equation*}
  B=0, \hspace{1cm} AC < 0
\end{equation*}
!et
we get the $2+1$-dim wave equation which is an example of a so-called 
elliptic PDE, where more generally we have
$B^2 > AC$.
For $B^2 <  AC$ 
we obtain a so-called hyperbolic PDE, with the Laplace equation in 
Eq. (ref{eq:laplacepde}) as one of the 
classical examples.
These equations can all be easily extended to non-linear partial differential
equations and $3+1$ dimensional cases.


!split
===== Diffusion equation =====
The diffusion equation describes in typical applications the evolution in time of the density $u$ of a quantity like
the particle density, energy density, temperature gradient, chemical concentrations etc.

The basis is the assumption that the flux density $\mathbf{\rho}$ obeys the Gauss-Green theorem

!bt
\begin{equation*}
\int_V \mathrm{div}\mathbf{\rho} dx = \int_{\partial V} \mathbf{\rho}\mathbf{n}dS,
\end{equation*}
!et
where $n$ is the unit outer normal field and $V$ is a smooth region with the space where
we seek a solution.  
The Gauss-Green theorem leads to

!bt
\begin{equation*} 
 \mathrm{div} \mathbf{\rho} = 0.
\end{equation*}
!et

!split
===== Diffusion equation =====
Assuming that the flux is proportional to the gradient $\mathbf{\nabla} u$ but pointing in the opposite direction
since the flow is from regions  of high concetration to lower concentrations, we obtain

!bt
\begin{equation*}
\mathbf{\rho} = -D\mathbf{\nabla} u,
\end{equation*}
!et
resulting in

!bt
\begin{equation*} 
\mathrm{div} \mathbf{\nabla} u  = D\Delta u = 0,
\end{equation*}
!et
which is Laplace's equation. The constant $D$ can be coupled with various physical 
constants, such as the diffusion constant or the specific heat and thermal conductivity discussed below. 

!split
===== Diffusion equation, famous laws =====
If we let $u$ denote the concetration of a particle species, this results in Fick's law of diffusion. 
If it denotes the temperature gradient, we have Fourier'slaw of heat conduction and if it refers to the 
electrostatic potential we have Ohm's law of electrical conduction.

Coupling the rate of change (temporal dependence) of $u$ with the flux density we have

!bt
\begin{equation*}   
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = -\mathrm{div}\mathbf{\rho}, 
\end{equation*}
!et
which results in

!bt
\begin{equation*} 
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}= D \mathrm{div} \mathbf{\nabla} u  = D \Delta u,
\end{equation*}
!et
the diffusion equation, or heat equation.

!split
===== Diffusion equation, heat equation =====
If we specialize to the heat equation, 
we assume that the diffusion of heat through some 
material is proportional with the temperature gradient $T(\mathbf{x},t)$
and using 
conservation of energy we arrive at the diffusion equation

!bt
\begin{equation*}
 \frac{\kappa}{C\rho}\nabla^2 T(\mathbf{x},t) =\frac{\partial T(\mathbf{x},t)}{\partial t}
\end{equation*}
!et
where $C$ is the specific heat and  $\rho$ 
the density of the material. 
Here we let the density be represented by a 
constant, but there is no problem introducing  an explicit spatial dependence, viz.,

!bt
\begin{equation*}
 \frac{\kappa}{C\rho(\mathbf{x},t)}\nabla^2 T(\mathbf{x},t) =
\frac{\partial T(\mathbf{x},t)}{\partial t}.
\end{equation*}
!et

!split
===== Diffusion equation, heat equation in one dimension =====
Setting all constants equal to the diffusion constant $D$, i.e.,

!bt
\begin{equation*}
    D=\frac{C\rho}{\kappa},
\end{equation*}
!et
we arrive at

!bt
\begin{equation*}
 \nabla^2 T(\mathbf{x},t) =
D\frac{\partial T(\mathbf{x},t)}{\partial t}.
\end{equation*}
!et
Specializing to the $1+1$-dimensional case we have

!bt
\begin{equation*}
 \frac{\partial^2 T(x,t)}{\partial x^2}=D\frac{\partial T(x,t)}{\partial t}.
\end{equation*}
!et

!split
===== Diffusion equation, dimensionless form =====
We note that the dimension of $D$ is time/length$^2$.
Introducing the dimensionless variables $\alpha\hat{x}=x$
we get

!bt
\begin{equation*}
 \frac{\partial^2 T(x,t)}{\alpha^2\partial \hat{x}^2}=
D\frac{\partial T(x,t)}{\partial t},
\end{equation*}
!et
and since $\alpha$ is just a constant we could define
$\alpha^2D= 1$ or use the last expression to define a dimensionless time-variable 
$\hat{t}$. This yields a simplified diffusion equation

!bt
\begin{equation*}
 \frac{\partial^2 T(\hat{x},\hat{t})}{\partial \hat{x}^2}=
\frac{\partial T(\hat{x},\hat{t})}{\partial \hat{t}}.
\end{equation*}
!et
It is now a partial differential equation in terms of dimensionless
variables. In the discussion below, we will however, for the sake
of notational simplicity replace $\hat{x}\rightarrow x$ and 
$\hat{t}\rightarrow t$. Moreover, the solution to the $1+1$-dimensional
partial differential equation is replaced by $T(\hat{x},\hat{t})\rightarrow u(x,t)$.

!split
===== Explicit Scheme =====
In one dimension we have the following equation

!bt
\begin{equation*}
 \nabla^2 u(x,t) =\frac{\partial u(x,t)}{\partial t},
\end{equation*}
!et
or

!bt
\begin{equation*}
u_{xx} = u_t,
\end{equation*}
!et
with initial conditions, i.e., the conditions at $t=0$,

!bt
\begin{equation*}
u(x,0)= g(x) \hspace{0.5cm} 0 < x < L
\end{equation*}
!et
with $L=1$ the length of the $x$-region of interest. 

!split
===== Explicit Scheme, boundary conditions =====
The  boundary conditions are

!bt
\begin{equation*}
u(0,t)= a(t) \hspace{0.5cm} t \ge 0,
\end{equation*}
!et
and

!bt
\begin{equation*}
u(L,t)= b(t) \hspace{0.5cm} t \ge 0,
\end{equation*}
!et
where $a(t)$ and $b(t)$ are two functions which depend on time only, while
$g(x)$ depends only on the position $x$.
Our next step is to find a numerical algorithm for solving this equation. Here we recur
to our familiar equal-step methods
and introduce different step lengths for the space-variable $x$ and time $t$ through
the  step length for $x$

!bt
\begin{equation*}
\Delta x=\frac{1}{n+1}
\end{equation*}
!et
and the time step length $\Delta t$. The position after $i$ steps and
time at time-step $j$ are now given by

!bt
\begin{equation*}
\begin{array}{cc} t_j=j\Delta t & j \ge 0 \\
                  x_i=i\Delta x & 0 \le i \le n+1\end{array} 
\end{equation*}
!et

!split
===== Explicit Scheme, algorithm =====
If we use standard approximations for the derivatives we obtain

!bt
\begin{equation*}
u_t\approx \frac{u(x,t+\Delta t)-u(x,t)}{\Delta t}=\frac{u(x_i,t_j+\Delta t)-u(x_i,t_j)}{\Delta t}
\end{equation*}
!et
with a local approximation error $O(\Delta t)$  
and

!bt
\begin{equation*}
u_{xx}\approx \frac{u(x+\Delta x,t)-2u(x,t)+u(x-\Delta x,t)}{\Delta x^2},
\end{equation*}
!et
or

!bt
\begin{equation*}
u_{xx}\approx \frac{u(x_i+\Delta x,t_j)-2u(x_i,t_j)+u(x_i-\Delta x,t_j)}{\Delta x^2},
\end{equation*}
!et
with a local approximation error $O(\Delta x^2)$. Our approximation is to higher order
in coordinate space. This can be justified since in most cases it is the spatial
dependence which causes numerical problems.

!split
===== Explicit Scheme, simplifications =====
These equations can be further simplified as

!bt
\begin{equation*}
u_t\approx \frac{u_{i,j+1}-u_{i,j}}{\Delta t}, 
\end{equation*}
!et
and

!bt
\begin{equation*}
u_{xx}\approx \frac{u_{i+1,j}-2u_{i,j}+u_{i-1,j}}{\Delta x^2}.
\end{equation*}
!et
The one-dimensional diffusion equation can then be rewritten in its
discretized version as

!bt
\begin{equation*}
\frac{u_{i,j+1}-u_{i,j}}{\Delta t}=\frac{u_{i+1,j}-2u_{i,j}+u_{i-1,j}}{\Delta x^2}.
\end{equation*}
!et
Defining $\alpha = \Delta t/\Delta x^2$ results in the explicit scheme

!bt
\begin{equation}
label{eq:explicitpde}
 u_{i,j+1}= \alpha u_{i-1,j}+(1-2\alpha)u_{i,j}+\alpha u_{i+1,j}.
\end{equation}
!et

!split
===== Explicit Scheme, solving the equations =====
Since all the discretized initial values

!bt
\begin{equation*}
   u_{i,0} = g(x_i),
\end{equation*}
!et
are known, then after one time-step the only unknown quantity is
$u_{i,1}$ which is given by

!bt
\begin{equation*}
 u_{i,1}= \alpha u_{i-1,0}+(1-2\alpha)u_{i,0}+\alpha u_{i+1,0}=
\alpha g(x_{i-1})+(1-2\alpha)g(x_{i})+\alpha g(x_{i+1}).
\end{equation*}
!et
We can then obtain $u_{i,2}$ using the previously calculated values $u_{i,1}$
and the boundary conditions $a(t)$ and $b(t)$. 
This algorithm results in a so-called explicit scheme, since the next functions
$u_{i,j+1}$ are explicitely given by Eq. (ref{eq:explicitpde}).


!split
===== Explicit Scheme, simple case =====
We specialize to the case
$a(t)=b(t)=0$ which results in  $u_{0,j}=u_{n+1,j}=0$.
We can then reformulate our partial differential equation through the vector 
$V_j$ at the time  $t_j=j\Delta t$

!bt
\begin{equation*}
 V_j=\begin{bmatrix}u_{1,j}\\ u_{2,j} \\ \dots \\ u_{n,j}\end{bmatrix}.
\end{equation*}
!et

!split
===== Explicit Scheme, matrix-vector formulation =====
This results in a matrix-vector multiplication
!bt
\begin{equation*}
   V_{j+1} = \mathbf{A}V_{j}
\end{equation*}
!et
with the matrix $\mathbf{A}$ given by
!bt
\begin{equation*}
 \mathbf{A}=\begin{bmatrix}1-2\alpha&\alpha&0& 0\dots\\ 
                            \alpha&1-2\alpha&\alpha & 0\dots \\ 
                            \dots & \dots & \dots & \dots \\
                      0\dots & 0\dots &\alpha& 1-2\alpha\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}
!et
which means we can rewrite the original partial differential equation as
a set of matrix-vector multiplications
!bt
\begin{equation*}
   V_{j+1} = \mathbf{A}V_{j}=\dots = \mathbf{A}^{j+1}V_0,
\end{equation*}
!et
where $V_0$ is the initial vector at time $t=0$ defined by the initial value
$g(x)$. 
In the numerical implementation 
one should avoid to treat this problem as a matrix vector multiplication
since the matrix is triangular and at most three elements in each row are different from zero.


!split
===== Explicit Scheme, sketch of code =====
It is rather easy to implement this matrix-vector multiplication as seen in the following piece of code

!bc
//  First we set initialise the new and old vectors
//  Here we have chosen the boundary conditions to be zero.
//  n+1 is the number of mesh points in x
//  Armadillo notation for vectors
    u(0) = unew(0) = u(n) = unew(n) = 0.0;
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
      x =  i*step;
      //  initial condition
      u(i) =  func(x);
      //  intitialise the new vector 
      unew(i) = 0;
    }
   // Time integration
   for (int t = 1; t <= tsteps; t++) {
      for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
         // Discretized diff eq
         unew(i) = alpha * u(i-1) + (1 - 2*alpha) * u(i) + alpha * u(i+1);
      }
   //  note that the boundaries are not changed.
!ec

!split
===== Explicit Scheme, stability condition =====
However, although the explicit scheme is easy to implement, it has a very weak 
stability condition,  given by

!bt
\begin{equation*}
  \Delta t/\Delta x^2 \le 1/2.
\end{equation*}
!et
This means that if $\Delta x = 0.01$ (a rather frequent choice), then $\Delta t= 5\times 10^{-5}$. This has obviously 
bad consequences if our time interval is large.
In order to derive this relation we need some results from studies of iterative schemes. 
If we require that our solution approaches a definite value after 
a certain amount of time steps we need to require that the so-called
spectral radius $\rho(\mathbf{A})$ of our matrix $\mathbf{A}$ satisfies the condition

!bt
\begin{equation}
label{eq:rhoconverge}
   \rho(\mathbf{A}) < 1.
\end{equation}
!et

!split
===== Explicit Scheme, spectral radius and stability =====
The spectral radius is defined 
as

!bt
\begin{equation*}
    \rho(\mathbf{A}) = \hspace{0.1cm}\mathrm{max}\left\{|\lambda|:\mathrm{det}(\mathbf{A}-\lambda\hat{I})=0\right\},
\end{equation*}
!et 
which is interpreted as the smallest number such that a circle  with radius centered at zero in the complex plane
contains all eigenvalues of $\mathbf{A}$. If the matrix is positive definite, the condition in 
Eq. (ref{eq:rhoconverge}) is always satisfied.

!split
===== Explicit Scheme, eigenvalues and stability =====
We can obtain closed-form expressions for the  eigenvalues of $\mathbf{A}$. To achieve this it is convenient
to rewrite the matrix as

!bt
\begin{equation*}
 \mathbf{A}=\hat{I}-\alpha\hat{B},
\end{equation*}
!et
with

!bt
\begin{equation*}
\hat{B} =\begin{bmatrix}2&-1&0& 0 &\dots\\ 
                           -1&2&-1& 0&\dots \\ 
                            \dots & \dots & \dots & \dots & -1 \\
                      0 & 0 &\dots &-1&2\end{bmatrix}.
\end{equation*}
!et
 
!split
===== Explicit Scheme, final stability analysis =====
The eigenvalues of $\mathbf{A}$ are $\lambda_i=1-\alpha\mu_i$, with $\mu_i$ being the
eigenvalues of $\hat{B}$. To find $\mu_i$ we note that the matrix elements of $\hat{B}$ are

!bt
\begin{equation*}
b_{ij} = 2\delta_{ij}-\delta_{i+1j}-\delta_{i-1j},
\end{equation*}
!et
meaning that we 
have the following set of eigenequations for component $i$

!bt
\begin{equation*}
(\hat{B}\hat{x})_i = \mu_ix_i, 
\end{equation*}
!et
resulting in

!bt
\begin{equation*}
(\hat{B}\hat{x})_i=\sum_{j=1}^n\left(2\delta_{ij}-\delta_{i+1j}-\delta_{i-1j}\right)x_j =
2x_i-x_{i+1}-x_{i-1}=\mu_ix_i.
\end{equation*}
!et

!split
===== Explicit Scheme, stability condition =====
If we assume that $x$ can be expanded in a basis of $x=(\sin{(\theta)}, \sin{(2\theta)},\dots, \sin{(n\theta)})$
with $\theta = l\pi/n+1$, where we have the endpoints given by $x_0 = 0$ and $x_{n+1}=0$, we can rewrite the 
last equation as

!bt
\begin{equation*}
2\sin{(i\theta)}-\sin{((i+1)\theta)}-\sin{((i-1)\theta)}=\mu_i\sin{(i\theta)},
\end{equation*}
!et
or

!bt
\begin{equation*}
2\left(1-\cos{(\theta)}\right)\sin{(i\theta)}=\mu_i\sin{(i\theta)},
\end{equation*}
!et
which is nothing but

!bt
\begin{equation*}
2\left(1-\cos{(\theta)}\right)x_i=\mu_ix_i,
\end{equation*}
!et
with eigenvalues $\mu_i = 2-2\cos{(\theta)}$. 

Our requirement in 
Eq. (ref{eq:rhoconverge}) results in

!bt
\begin{equation*}
-1 < 1-\alpha2\left(1-\cos{(\theta)}\right) < 1,
\end{equation*}
!et
which is satisfied only if $\alpha < \left(1-\cos{(\theta)}\right)^{-1}$ resulting in
$\alpha \le 1/2$ or $\Delta t/\Delta x^2 \le 1/2$. 

!split
===== Explicit Scheme, general tridiagonal matrix =====
A more general tridiagonal matrix
!bt
\begin{equation*}
\mathbf{A} =\begin{bmatrix}a&b&0& 0 &\dots\\ 
                           c&a&b& 0&\dots \\ 
                            \dots & \dots & \dots & \dots & b \\
                      0 & 0 &\dots &c&a\end{bmatrix},
\end{equation*}
!et
has eigenvalues $\mu_i=a+s\sqrt{bc}\cos{(i\pi/n+1)}$ with $i=1:n$. 


!split
===== Implicit Scheme =====
In deriving the equations for the explicit scheme we started with the so-called 
forward formula for the first derivative, i.e., we used the discrete approximation

!bt
\begin{equation*}
u_t\approx \frac{u(x_i,t_j+\Delta t)-u(x_i,t_j)}{\Delta t}.
\end{equation*}
!et
However, there is nothing which hinders us from using the backward formula

!bt
\begin{equation*}
u_t\approx \frac{u(x_i,t_j)-u(x_i,t_j-\Delta t)}{\Delta t},
\end{equation*}
!et
still with a truncation error which goes like $O(\Delta t)$.

!split
===== Implicit Scheme =====
We could also have used a midpoint approximation for the first derivative, resulting in

!bt
\begin{equation*}
u_t\approx \frac{u(x_i,t_j+\Delta t)-u(x_i,t_j-\Delta t)}{2\Delta t},
\end{equation*}
!et
with a truncation error $O(\Delta t^2)$. 
Here we will stick to the backward formula and come back to the latter below. 
For the second derivative we use however

!bt
\begin{equation*}
u_{xx}\approx \frac{u(x_i+\Delta x,t_j)-2u(x_i,t_j)+u(x_i-\Delta x,t_j)}{\Delta x^2},
\end{equation*}
!et
and define again $\alpha = \Delta t/\Delta x^2$.  

!split
===== Implicit Scheme =====
We obtain now
!bt
\begin{equation*}
 u_{i,j-1}= -\alpha u_{i-1,j}+(1-2\alpha)u_{i,j}-\alpha u_{i+1,j}.
\end{equation*}
!et
Here $u_{i,j-1}$ is the only unknown quantity. 
Defining the matrix 
$\mathbf{A}$
!bt
\begin{equation*}
 \mathbf{A}=\begin{bmatrix}1+2\alpha&-\alpha&0& 0 &\dots\\ 
                            -\alpha&1+2\alpha&-\alpha & 0 & \dots \\ 
                            \dots & \dots & \dots & \dots &\dots  \\
                            \dots & \dots & \dots & \dots & -\alpha \\
                      0 & 0 &\dots &-\alpha& 1+2\alpha\end{bmatrix},
\end{equation*}
!et
we can reformulate again the problem as a matrix-vector multiplication
!bt
\begin{equation*}
   \mathbf{A}V_{j} = V_{j-1}
\end{equation*}
!et
!split
===== Implicit Scheme =====
It means that we can rewrite the problem as
!bt
\begin{equation*}
   V_{j} = \mathbf{A}^{-1}V_{j-1}=\mathbf{A}^{-1}\left(\mathbf{A}^{-1}V_{j-2}\right)=\dots = \mathbf{A}^{-j}V_0.
\end{equation*}
!et
This is an implicit scheme since it relies on determining the vector
$u_{i,j-1}$ instead of $u_{i,j+1}$.
If $\alpha$ does not depend on time $t$, we need 
to invert a matrix only once. Alternatively we can solve this system of equations using our methods
from linear algebra.
These are however very cumbersome ways of solving since they involve $\sim O(N^3)$ operations 
for  a $N\times N$ matrix. 
It is much faster to solve these linear equations using methods for tridiagonal matrices,
since these involve only $\sim O(N)$ operations. 

!split
===== Implicit Scheme =====
The implicit scheme is always stable since the spectral radius satisfies $\rho(\mathbf{A}) < 1 $. We could have inferred this by noting that 
the matrix is positive definite, viz. all eigenvalues are larger than zero. We see this from
the fact that $\mathbf{A}=\hat{I}+\alpha\hat{B}$ has eigenvalues
$\lambda_i = 1+\alpha(2-2cos(\theta))$ which satisfy $\lambda_i > 1$. Since it is the inverse which stands
to the right of our iterative equation, we have $\rho(\mathbf{A}^{-1}) < 1 $ 
and the method is stable for all combinations
of $\Delta t$ and $\Delta x$.

!split
=== Program Example for Implicit Equation ===
We show here parts of a  simple example of how to solve the one-dimensional diffusion equation using the implicit
scheme discussed above. The program uses the function to solve linear equations with a tridiagonal 
matrix.

!bc
//  parts of the function for backward Euler
void backward_euler(int n, int tsteps, double delta_x, double alpha)
{
   double a, b, c;
   vec u(n+1); // This is u  of Au = y
   vec y(n+1); // Right side of matrix equation Au=y, the solution at a previous step
   
   // Initial conditions
   for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
      y(i) = u(i) = func(delta_x*i);
   }
   // Boundary conditions (zero here)
   y(n) = u(n) = u(0) = y(0);
   // Matrix A, only constants
   a = c = - alpha;
   b = 1 + 2*alpha;
   // Time iteration
   for (int t = 1; t <= tsteps; t++) {
      //  here we solve the tridiagonal linear set of equations, 
      tridag(a, b, c, y, u, n+1);
      // boundary conditions
      u(0) = 0;
      u(n) = 0;
      // replace previous time solution with new
      for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
	 y(i) = u(i);
      }
      //  You may consider printing the solution at regular time intervals
      ....   // print statements
   }  // end time iteration
   ...
}
!ec

!split
===== Crank-Nicolson scheme =====
It is possible to combine the implicit and explicit methods in a slightly more general
approach. Introducing a parameter $\theta$ (the so-called $\theta$-rule) we can set up 
an equation
!bt
\begin{equation}
label{eq:cranknicolson}
  \frac{\theta}{\Delta x^2}\left(u_{i-1,j}-2u_{i,j}+u_{i+1,j}\right)+
  \frac{1-\theta}{\Delta x^2}\left(u_{i+1,j-1}-2u_{i,j-1}+u_{i-1,j-1}\right)=
  \frac{1}{\Delta t}\left(u_{i,j}-u_{i,j-1}\right),
\end{equation}
!et
which for $\theta=0$ yields the forward formula for the first derivative and
the explicit scheme, while $\theta=1$ yields the backward formula and the implicit
scheme. These two schemes are called the backward and forward Euler schemes, respectively.
For $\theta = 1/2$ we obtain a new scheme after its inventors, Crank and Nicolson.
This scheme yields a truncation in time which goes like $O(\Delta t^2)$ and it is stable 
for all possible combinations of $\Delta t$ and $\Delta x$.

!split
===== Derivation of CN scheme =====
To derive the Crank-Nicolson equation, 
we start with the forward Euler scheme and Taylor expand $u(x,t+\Delta t)$,
$u(x+\Delta x, t)$ and $u(x-\Delta x,t)$
!bt
\begin{align}
u(x+\Delta x,t)&=u(x,t)+\frac{\partial u(x,t)}{\partial x} \Delta x+\frac{\partial^2 u(x,t)}{2\partial x^2}\Delta x^2+\mathcal{O}(\Delta x^3),\\ \nonumber
u(x-\Delta x,t)&=u(x,t)-\frac{\partial u(x,t)}{\partial x}\Delta x+\frac{\partial^2 u(x,t)}{2\partial x^2} \Delta x^2+\mathcal{O}(\Delta x^3),\\ \nonumber
u(x,t+\Delta t)&=u(x,t)+\frac{\partial u(x,t)}{\partial t}\Delta t+  \mathcal{O}(\Delta t^2).
label{eq:deltat0}
\end{align}
!et

!split
===== Taylor expansions =====
With these Taylor expansions the approximations for the derivatives takes the form
!bt
\begin{align}
&\left[\frac{\partial u(x,t)}{\partial t}\right]_{\text{approx}} =\frac{\partial u(x,t)}{\partial t}+\mathcal{O}(\Delta t) , \\ \nonumber
&\left[\frac{\partial^2 u(x,t)}{\partial x^2}\right]_{\text{approx}}=\frac{\partial^2 u(x,t)}{\partial x^2}+\mathcal{O}(\Delta x^2).
\end{align}
!et
It is easy to convince oneself that the backward Euler method must have the same truncation errors as the forward Euler scheme.


!split
===== Error in CN scheme =====
For the Crank-Nicolson scheme we also need to Taylor expand $u(x+\Delta x, t+\Delta t)$ and $u(x-\Delta x, t+\Delta t)$ around $t'=t+\Delta t/2$.
!bt
\begin{align}
u(x+\Delta x, t+\Delta t)&=u(x,t')+\frac{\partial u(x,t')}{\partial x}\Delta x+\frac{\partial u(x,t')}{\partial t} \frac{\Delta t}{2} +\frac{\partial^2 u(x,t')}{2\partial x^2}\Delta x^2+\frac{\partial^2 u(x,t')}{2\partial t^2}\frac{\Delta t^2}{4} +\notag \\  \nonumber
&\frac{\partial^2 u(x,t')}{\partial x\partial t}\frac{\Delta t}{2} \Delta x+ \mathcal{O}(\Delta t^3)\\ \nonumber

!split
===== Type of problem =====

The problem our network must solve for, is similar to the ODE case.
We must have a trial solution $g_t$ at hand.

For instance, the trial solution could be expressed as
!bt
\begin{align*}
  g_t(x_1,\dots,x_N) = h_1(x_1,\dots,x_N) + h_2(x_1,\dots,x_N,N(x_1,\dots,x_N,P))
\end{align*}
!et
where $h_1(x_1,\dots,x_N)$ is a function that ensures $g_t(x_1,\dots,x_N)$ satisfies some given conditions.
The neural network $N(x_1,\dots,x_N,P)$ has weights and biases described by $P$ and $h_2(x_1,\dots,x_N,N(x_1,\dots,x_N,P))$ is an expression using the output from the neural network in some way.

The role of the function $h_2(x_1,\dots,x_N,N(x_1,\dots,x_N,P))$, is to ensure that the output of $N(x_1,\dots,x_N,P)$ is zero when $g_t(x_1,\dots,x_N)$ is evaluated at the values of $x_1,\dots,x_N$ where the given conditions must be satisfied. The function $h_1(x_1,\dots,x_N)$ should alone make $g_t(x_1,\dots,x_N)$ satisfy the conditions.


!split
===== Network requirements =====

The network tries then the minimize the cost function following the
same ideas as described for the ODE case, but now with more than one
variables to consider.  The concept still remains the same; find a set
of parameters $P$ such that the expression $f$ in (ref{PDE}) is as
close to zero as possible.

As for the ODE case, the cost function is the mean squared error that
the network must try to minimize. The cost function for the network to
minimize is

!bt
\begin{equation*}
C\left(x_1, \dots, x_N, P\right) = \left(  f\left(x_1, \, \dots \, , x_N, \frac{\partial g(x_1,\dots,x_N) }{\partial x_1}, \dots , \frac{\partial g(x_1,\dots,x_N) }{\partial x_N}, \frac{\partial g(x_1,\dots,x_N) }{\partial x_1\partial x_2}, \, \dots \, , \frac{\partial^n g(x_1,\dots,x_N) }{\partial x_N^n} \right) \right)^2
\end{equation*}
!et

!split
===== More details =====

If we let $\bm{x} = \big( x_1, \dots, x_N \big)$ be an array containing the values for $x_1, \dots, x_N$ respectively, the cost function can be reformulated into the following:
!bt
\[
	C\left(\bm{x}, P\right) = f\left( \left( \bm{x}, \frac{\partial g(\bm{x}) }{\partial x_1}, \dots , \frac{\partial g(\bm{x}) }{\partial x_N}, \frac{\partial g(\bm{x}) }{\partial x_1\partial x_2}, \, \dots \, , \frac{\partial^n g(\bm{x}) }{\partial x_N^n} \right) \right)^2
\]
!et

If we also have $M$ different sets of values for $x_1, \dots, x_N$, that is $\bm{x}_i = \big(x_1^{(i)}, \dots, x_N^{(i)}\big)$ for $i = 1,\dots,M$ being the rows in matrix $X$, the cost function can be generalized into
!bt
\begin{equation*}
C\left(X, P \right) = \sum_{i=1}^M f\left( \left( \bm{x}_i, \frac{\partial g(\bm{x}_i) }{\partial x_1}, \dots , \frac{\partial g(\bm{x}_i) }{\partial x_N}, \frac{\partial g(\bm{x}_i) }{\partial x_1\partial x_2}, \, \dots \, , \frac{\partial^n g(\bm{x}_i) }{\partial x_N^n} \right) \right)^2.
\end{equation*}
!et

!split
===== Example: The diffusion equation =====

In one spatial dimension, the equation reads
!bt
\begin{equation*}
  \frac{\partial g(x,t)}{\partial t} = \frac{\partial^2 g(x,t)}{\partial x^2}
\end{equation*}
!et

where a possible choice of conditions are
!bt
\begin{align*}
g(0,t) &= 0 ,\qquad t \geq 0 \\
g(1,t) &= 0, \qquad t \geq 0 \\
g(x,0) &= u(x),\qquad x\in [0,1]
\end{align*}
!et
with $u(x)$ being some given function.

!split
===== Defining the problem =====

For this case, we want to find $g(x,t)$ such that

!bt
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\partial g(x,t)}{\partial t} = \frac{\partial^2 g(x,t)}{\partial x^2}
\end{equation} \label{diffonedim}
!et

and

!bt
\begin{align*}
g(0,t) &= 0 ,\qquad t \geq 0 \\
g(1,t) &= 0, \qquad t \geq 0 \\
g(x,0) &= u(x),\qquad x\in [0,1]
\end{align*}
!et
with $u(x) = \sin(\pi x)$.

First, let us set up the deep neural network.
The deep neural network will follow the same structure as discussed in the examples solving the ODEs.
First, we will look into how Autograd could be used in a network tailored to solve for bivariate functions.



!split
===== Setting up the network using Autograd =====

The only change to do here, is to extend our network such that
functions of multiple parameters are correctly handled.  In this case
we have two variables in our function to solve for, that is time $t$
and position $x$.  The variables will be represented by a
one-dimensional array in the program.  The program will evaluate the
network at each possible pair $(x,t)$, given an array for the desired
$x$-values and $t$-values to approximate the solution at.

        # From the list of parameters P; find the correct weigths and bias for this layer

        # Add a row of ones to include bias
        x_prev = np.concatenate((np.ones((1,num_points)), x_prev ), axis = 0)

        z_hidden = np.matmul(w_hidden, x_prev)
        x_hidden = sigmoid(z_hidden)

        # Update x_prev such that next layer can use the output from this layer
        x_prev = x_hidden

    ## Output layer:

    # Get the weights and bias for this layer

    # Include bias:
    x_prev = np.concatenate((np.ones((1,num_points)), x_prev), axis = 0)

    z_output = np.matmul(w_output, x_prev)
    x_output = z_output

    return x_output[0][0]
!ec

!split
===== Setting up the network using Autograd; The trial solution =====

The cost function must then iterate through the given arrays
containing values for $x$ and $t$, defines a point $(x,t)$ the deep
neural network and the trial solution is evaluated at, and then finds
the Jacobian of the trial solution.

A possible trial solution for this PDE is

$$
g_t(x,t) = h_1(x,t) + x(1-x)tN(x,t,P)
$$

with $A(x,t)$ being a function ensuring that $g_t(x,t)$ satisfies our given conditions, and $N(x,t,P)$ being the output from the deep neural network using weights and biases for each layer from $P$.

To fulfill the conditions, $A(x,t)$ could be:

$$
h_1(x,t) = (1-t)\Big(u(x) - \big((1-x)u(0) + x u(1)\big)\Big) = (1-t)u(x) = (1-t)\sin(\pi x)
$$
since $(0) = u(1) = 0$ and $u(x) = \sin(\pi x)$.

!split
===== Why the jacobian? =====

The Jacobian is used because the program must find the derivative of
the trial solution with respect to $x$ and $t$.

This gives the necessity of computing the Jacobian matrix, as we want
to evaluate the gradient with respect to $x$ and $t$ (note that the
Jacobian of a scalar-valued multivariate function is simply its
gradient).

In Autograd, the differentiation is by default done with respect to
the first input argument of your Python function. Since the points is
an array representing $x$ and $t$, the Jacobian is calculated using
the values of $x$ and $t$.

To find the second derivative with respect to $x$ and $t$, the
Jacobian can be found for the second time. The result is a Hessian
matrix, which is the matrix containing all the possible second order
mixed derivatives of $g(x,t)$.

===== Setting up the network using Autograd; The full program =====

Having set up the network, along with the trial solution and cost function, we can now see how the deep neural network performs by comparing the results to the analytical solution.

The analytical solution of our problem is

$$
g(x,t) = \exp(-\pi^2 t)\sin(\pi x)
$$

A possible way to implement a neural network solving the PDE, is given below.
Be aware, though, that it is fairly slow for the parameters used.
A better result is possible, but requires more iterations, and thus longer time to complete.


Indeed, the program below is not optimal in its implementation, but rather serves as an example on how to implement and use a neural network to solve a PDE.
Using TensorFlow results in a much better execution time. Try it!

===== Example: Solving the wave equation with Neural Networks =====

The wave equation is
!bt
\begin{equation*}
	\frac{\partial^2 g(x,t)}{\partial t^2} = c^2\frac{\partial^2 g(x,t)}{\partial x^2}
\end{equation*}
!et

with $c$ being the specified wave speed.

Here, the chosen conditions are
!bt
\begin{align*}
	g(0,t) &= 0 \\
	g(1,t) &= 0 \\
	g(x,0) &= u(x) \\
	\frac{\partial g(x,t)}{\partial t} \Big |_{t = 0} &= v(x)
\end{align*}
!et
where $\frac{\partial g(x,t)}{\partial t} \Big |_{t = 0}$ means the derivative of $g(x,t)$ with respect to $t$ is evaluated at $t = 0$, and $u(x)$ and $v(x)$ being given functions.

!split
===== The problem to solve for =====

The wave equation to solve for, is

!bt
\begin{equation} \label{wave}
\frac{\partial^2 g(x,t)}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \frac{\partial^2 g(x,t)}{\partial x^2}
\end{equation}
!et

where $c$ is the given wave speed.
The chosen conditions for this equation are

!bt
\begin{aligned}
g(0,t) &= 0, &t \geq 0 \\
g(1,t) &= 0, &t \geq 0 \\
g(x,0) &= u(x), &x\in[0,1] \\
\frac{\partial g(x,t)}{\partial t}\Big |_{t = 0} &= v(x), &x \in [0,1]
\end{aligned} \label{condwave}

In this example, let $c = 1$ and $u(x) = \sin(\pi x)$ and $v(x) = -\pi\sin(\pi x)$.


!split
===== The trial solution =====
Setting up the network is done in similar matter as for the example of solving the diffusion equation.
The only things we have to change, is the trial solution such that it satisfies the conditions from (ref{condwave}) and the cost function.

The trial solution becomes slightly different since we have other conditions than in the example of solving the diffusion equation. Here, a possible trial solution $g_t(x,t)$ is

$$
g_t(x,t) = h_1(x,t) + x(1-x)t^2N(x,t,P)
$$

where

$$
h_1(x,t) = (1-t^2)u(x) + tv(x)
$$

Note that this trial solution satisfies the conditions only if $u(0) = v(0) = u(1) = v(1) = 0$, which is the case in this example.

===== The analytical solution =====

The analytical solution for our specific problem, is
