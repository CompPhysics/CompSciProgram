===== CNNs in brief =====

In summary:

* A CNN architecture is in the simplest case a list of Layers that transform the image volume into an output volume (e.g. holding the class scores)
* There are a few distinct types of Layers (e.g. CONV/FC/RELU/POOL are by far the most popular)
* Each Layer accepts an input 3D volume and transforms it to an output 3D volume through a differentiable function
* Each Layer may or may not have parameters (e.g. CONV/FC do, RELU/POOL don’t)
* Each Layer may or may not have additional hyperparameters (e.g. CONV/FC/POOL do, RELU doesn’t)

For more material on convolutional networks, we strongly recommend
the course
"IN5400 – Machine Learning for Image Analysis":"https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/ifi/IN5400/index-eng.html"
and the slides of "CS231":"http://cs231n.github.io/convolutional-networks/" which is taught at Stanford University (consistently ranked as one of the top computer science programs in the world). "Michael Nielsen's book is a must read, in particular chapter 6 which deals with CNNs":"http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap6.html".


However, both standard feed forwards networks and CNNs perform well on data with unknown length.

This is where recurrent nueral networks (RNNs) come to our rescue.

===== Recurrent neural networks: Overarching view =====

Till now our focus has been, including convolutional neural networks
as well, on feedforward neural networks. The output or the activations
flow only in one direction, from the input layer to the output layer.

A recurrent neural network (RNN) looks very much like a feedforward
neural network, except that it also has connections pointing
backward. 

RNNs are used to analyze time series data such as stock prices, and
tell you when to buy or sell. In autonomous driving systems, they can
anticipate car trajectories and help avoid accidents. More generally,
they can work on sequences of arbitrary lengths, rather than on
fixed-sized inputs like all the nets we have discussed so far. For
example, they can take sentences, documents, or audio samples as
input, making them extremely useful for natural language processing
systems such as automatic translation and speech-to-text.

The following code provides an example of how recurrent neural
networks can be used to extrapolate to unknown values of physics data
sets.  Specifically, the data sets used in this program come from
a quantum mechanical many-body calculation of energies as functions of the number of particles.

===== Formatting the Data =====

The way the recurrent neural networks are trained in this program
differs from how machine learning algorithms are usually trained.
Typically a machine learning algorithm is trained by learning the
relationship between the x data and the y data.  In this program, the
recurrent neural network will be trained to recognize the relationship
in a sequence of y values.  This is type of data formatting is
typically used time series forcasting, but it can also be used in any
extrapolation (time series forecasting is just a specific type of
extrapolation along the time axis).  This method of data formatting
does not use the x data and assumes that the y data are evenly spaced.

For a standard machine learning algorithm, the training data has the
form of (x,y) so the machine learning algorithm learns to assiciate a
y value with a given x value.  This is useful when the test data has x
values within the same range as the training data.  However, for this
application, the x values of the test data are outside of the x values
of the training data and the traditional method of training a machine
learning algorithm does not work as well.  For this reason, the
recurrent neural network is trained on sequences of y values of the
form ((y1, y2), y3), so that the network is concerned with learning
the pattern of the y data and not the relation between the x and y
data.  As long as the pattern of y data outside of the training region
stays relatively stable compared to what was inside the training
region, this method of training can produce accurate extrapolations to
y values far removed from the training data set.


# 
# The idea behind formatting the data in this way comes from [this resource](https://machinelearningmastery.com/time-series-prediction-lstm-recurrent-neural-networks-python-keras/) and [this one](https://fairyonice.github.io/Understand-Keras%27s-RNN-behind-the-scenes-with-a-sin-wave-example.html).
# 
# The following method takes in a y data set and formats it so the "x data" are of the form (y1, y2) and the "y data" are of the form y3, with extra brackets added in to make the resulting arrays compatable with both Keras and Tensorflow.
# 
# Note: Using a sequence length of two is not required for time series forecasting so any lenght of sequence could be used (for example instead of ((y1, y2) y3) you could change the length of sequence to be 4 and the resulting data points would have the form ((y1, y2, y3, y4), y5)).  While the following method can be used to create a data set of any sequence length, the remainder of the code expects the length of sequence to be 2.  This is because the data sets are very small and the higher the lenght of the sequence the less resulting data points.

===== Other Things to Try =====


Changing the size of the recurrent neural network and its parameters
can drastically change the results you get from the model.  The below
code takes the simple recurrent neural network from above and adds a
second hidden layer, changes the number of neurons in the hidden
layer, and explicitly declares the activation function of the hidden
layers to be a sigmoid function.  The loss function and optimizer can
also be changed but are kept the same as the above network.  These
parameters can be tuned to provide the optimal result from the
network.  For some ideas on how to improve the performance of a

===== Other Types of Recurrent Neural Networks =====

Besides a simple recurrent neural network layer, there are two other
commonly used types of recurrent neural network layers: Long Short
Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU).  For a short
introduction to these layers see URL:"https://medium.com/mindboard/lstm-vs-gru-experimental-comparison-955820c21e8b"
and URL:"https://medium.com/mindboard/lstm-vs-gru-experimental-comparison-955820c21e8b".

The first network created below is similar to the previous network,
but it replaces the SimpleRNN layers with LSTM layers.  The second
network below has two hidden layers made up of GRUs, which are
preceeded by two dense (feeddorward) neural network layers.  These
dense layers "preprocess" the data before it reaches the recurrent
layers.  This architecture has been shown to improve the performance
of recurrent neural networks (see the link above and also
URL:"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.02857.pdf".

===== Generative Models =====

_Generative models_ describe a class of statistical models that are a contrast
to _discriminative models_. Informally we say that generative models can
generate new data instances while discriminative models discriminate between
different kinds of data instances. A generative model could generate new photos
of animals that look like 'real' animals while a discriminative model could tell
a dog from a cat. More formally, given a data set $x$ and a set of labels /
targets $y$. Generative models capture the joint probability $p(x, y)$, or
just $p(x)$ if there are no labels, while discriminative models capture the
conditional probability $p(y | x)$. Discriminative models generally try to draw
boundaries in the data space (often high dimensional), while generative models
try to model how data is placed throughout the space.

_Note_: this material is thanks to Linus Ekstrøm. 

!split
===== Generative Adversarial Networks =====

_Generative Adversarial Networks_ are a type of unsupervised machine learning
algorithm proposed by "Goodfellow et. al": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.2661.pdf"
in 2014 (short and good article).

The simplest formulation of
the model is based on a game theoretic approach, *zero sum game*, where we pit
two neural networks against one another. We define two rival networks, one
generator $g$, and one discriminator $d$. The generator directly produces
samples
!bt
\begin{equation}
    x = g(z; \theta^{(g)})
\end{equation}
!et


!split
===== Discriminator =====
The discriminator attempts to distinguish between samples drawn from the
training data and samples drawn from the generator. In other words, it tries to
tell the difference between the fake data produced by $g$ and the actual data
samples we want to do prediction on. The discriminator outputs a probability
value given by

!bt
\begin{equation}
    d(x; \theta^{(d)})
\end{equation}
!et

indicating the probability that $x$ is a real training example rather than a
fake sample the generator has generated. The simplest way to formulate the
learning process in a generative adversarial network is a zero-sum game, in
which a function

!bt
\begin{equation}
    v(\theta^{(g)}, \theta^{(d)})
\end{equation}
!et

determines the reward for the discriminator, while the generator gets the
conjugate reward

!bt
\begin{equation}
    -v(\theta^{(g)}, \theta^{(d)})
\end{equation}
!et


!split
===== Learning Process =====

During learning both of the networks maximize their own reward function, so that
the generator gets better and better at tricking the discriminator, while the
discriminator gets better and better at telling the difference between the fake
and real data. The generator and discriminator alternate on which one trains at
one time (i.e. for one epoch). In other words, we keep the generator constant
and train the discriminator, then we keep the discriminator constant to train
the generator and repeat. It is this back and forth dynamic which lets GANs
tackle otherwise intractable generative problems. As the generator improves with
 training, the discriminator's performance gets worse because it cannot easily
 tell the difference between real and fake. If the generator ends up succeeding
 perfectly, the the discriminator will do no better than random guessing i.e.
 50\%. This progression in the training poses a problem for the convergence
 criteria for GANs. The discriminator feedback gets less meaningful over time,
 if we continue training after this point then the generator is effectively
 training on junk data which can undo the learning up to that point. Therefore,
 we stop training when the discriminator starts outputting $1/2$ everywhere.


!split
===== More about the Learning Process =====

At convergence we have

!bt
\begin{equation}
    g^* = \underset{g}{\mathrm{argmin}}\hspace{2pt}
          \underset{d}{\mathrm{max}}v(\theta^{(g)}, \theta^{(d)})
\end{equation}
!et
The default choice for $v$ is
!bt
\begin{equation}
    v(\theta^{(g)}, \theta^{(d)}) = \mathbb{E}_{x\sim p_\mathrm{data}}\log d(x)
                                  + \mathbb{E}_{x\sim p_\mathrm{model}}
                                  \log (1 - d(x))
\end{equation}
!et
The main motivation for the design of GANs is that the learning process requires
neither approximate inference (variational autoencoders for example) nor
approximation of a partition function. In the case where
!bt
\begin{equation}
    \underset{d}{\mathrm{max}}v(\theta^{(g)}, \theta^{(d)})
\end{equation}
!et
is convex in $\theta^{(g)} then the procedure is guaranteed to converge and is
asymptotically consistent
( "Seth Lloyd on QuGANs": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.09139.pdf"  ).

!split
===== Additional References =====
This is in
general not the case and it is possible to get situations where the training
process never converges because the generator and discriminator chase one
another around in the parameter space indefinitely. A much deeper discussion on
the currently open research problem of GAN convergence is available
"here": "https://www.deeplearningbook.org/contents/generative_models.html". To
anyone interested in learning more about GANs it is a highly recommended read.
Direct quote: "In this best-performing formulation, the generator aims to
increase the log probability that the discriminator makes a mistake, rather than
aiming to decrease the log probability that the discriminator makes the correct
prediction." "Another interesting read": "https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.00160"

===== Writing Our First Generative Adversarial Network =====
Let us now move on to actually implementing a GAN in tensorflow. We will study
the performance of our GAN on the MNIST dataset. This code is based on and
adapted from the
"google tutorial": "https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/generative/dcgan"

First we import our libraries

!bc pycod
import os
import time
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from tensorflow.keras import layers
from tensorflow.keras.utils import plot_model
!ec

Next we define our hyperparameters and import our data the usual way

!bc pycod
BUFFER_SIZE = 60000
BATCH_SIZE = 256
EPOCHS = 30

data = tf.keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()
(train_images, train_labels), (test_images, test_labels) = data
train_images = np.reshape(train_images, (train_images.shape[0],
                                         28,
                                         28,
                                         1)).astype('float32')

# we normalize between -1 and 1
train_images = (train_images - 127.5) / 127.5
training_dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(
                      train_images).shuffle(BUFFER_SIZE).batch(BATCH_SIZE)
!ec

!split
===== MNIST and GANs =====

Let's have a quick look

!bc pycod
plt.imshow(train_images[0], cmap='Greys')
plt.show()
!ec

Now we define our two models. This is where the 'magic' happens. There are a
huge amount of possible formulations for both models. A lot of engineering and
trial and error can be done here to try to produce better performing models. For
more advanced GANs this is by far the step where you can 'make or break' a
model.

We start with the generator. As stated in the introductory text the generator
$g$ upsamples from a random sample to the shape of what we want to predict. In
our case we are trying to predict MNIST images ($28\times 28$ pixels).

!bc pycod
def generator_model():
    """
    The generator uses upsampling layers tf.keras.layers.Conv2DTranspose() to
    produce an image from a random seed. We start with a Dense layer taking this

    """

    model.add(layers.Dense(units=7*7*BATCH_SIZE,
                           use_bias=False,
                           input_shape=(100, )))
    # we normalize the output form the Dense layer
    model.add(layers.BatchNormalization())
    # and add an activation function to our 'layer'. LeakyReLU avoids vanishing
    # gradient problem
    model.add(layers.LeakyReLU())
    model.add(layers.Reshape((7, 7, BATCH_SIZE)))
    assert model.output_shape == (None, 7, 7, BATCH_SIZE)
    # even though we just added four keras layers we think of everything above
    # as 'one' layer

    # next we add our upscaling convolutional layers
    model.add(layers.Conv2DTranspose(filters=128,
                                     kernel_size=(5, 5),
                                     strides=(1, 1),
                                     padding='same',
                                     use_bias=False))
    model.add(layers.BatchNormalization())
    model.add(layers.LeakyReLU())
    assert model.output_shape == (None, 7, 7, 128)

    model.add(layers.Conv2DTranspose(filters=64,
                                     kernel_size=(5, 5),
                                     strides=(2, 2),
                                     padding='same',
                                     use_bias=False))
    model.add(layers.BatchNormalization())
    model.add(layers.LeakyReLU())
    assert model.output_shape == (None, 14, 14, 64)

    model.add(layers.Conv2DTranspose(filters=1,
                                     kernel_size=(5, 5),
                                     strides=(2, 2),
                                     padding='same',
                                     use_bias=False,
                                     activation='tanh'))
    assert model.output_shape == (None, 28, 28, 1)

    return model

!ec

And there we have our 'simple' generator model. Now we move on to defining our
discriminator model $d$, which is a convolutional neural network based image
classifier.

!bc pycod
def discriminator_model():
    """
    The discriminator is a convolutional neural network based image classifier
    """

    # we define our model
    model = tf.keras.Sequential()
    model.add(layers.Conv2D(filters=64,
                            kernel_size=(5, 5),
                            strides=(2, 2),
                            padding='same',
                            input_shape=[28, 28, 1]))
    model.add(layers.LeakyReLU())
    # adding a dropout layer as you do in conv-nets
    model.add(layers.Dropout(0.3))


    model.add(layers.Conv2D(filters=128,
                            kernel_size=(5, 5),
                            strides=(2, 2),
                            padding='same'))
    model.add(layers.LeakyReLU())
    # adding a dropout layer as you do in conv-nets
    model.add(layers.Dropout(0.3))

    model.add(layers.Flatten())
    model.add(layers.Dense(1))

    return model
!ec

!split
===== Other Models =====
Let us take a look at our models. _Note_: double click images for bigger view.

!bc pycod
generator = generator_model()
plot_model(generator, show_shapes=True, rankdir='LR')
!ec

!bc pycod
discriminator = discriminator_model()
plot_model(discriminator, show_shapes=True, rankdir='LR')
!ec

Next we need a few helper objects we will use in training

!bc pycod
cross_entropy = tf.keras.losses.BinaryCrossentropy(from_logits=True)
generator_optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(1e-4)
discriminator_optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(1e-4)
!ec

The first object, *cross_entropy* is our loss function and the two others are
our optimizers. Notice we use the same learning rate for both $g$ and $d$. This
is because they need to improve their accuracy at approximately equal speeds to
get convergence (not necessarily exactly equal). Now we define our loss
functions

!bc pycod
def generator_loss(fake_output):
    loss = cross_entropy(tf.ones_like(fake_output), fake_output)

    return loss
!ec

!bc pycod
def discriminator_loss(real_output, fake_output):
    real_loss = cross_entropy(tf.ones_like(real_output), real_output)
    fake_loss = cross_entropy(tf.zeros_liks(fake_output), fake_output)
    total_loss = real_loss + fake_loss

    return total_loss
!ec

Next we define a kind of seed to help us compare the learning process over
multiple training epochs.

!bc pycod
noise_dimension = 100
n_examples_to_generate = 16
seed_images = tf.random.normal([n_examples_to_generate, noise_dimension])
!ec

!split
===== Training Step =====

Now we have everything we need to define our training step, which we will apply
for every step in our training loop. Notice the @tf.function flag signifying
that the function is tensorflow 'compiled'. Removing this flag doubles the
computation time.

!bc pycod
@tf.function
def train_step(images):
    noise = tf.random.normal([BATCH_SIZE, noise_dimension])

    with tf.GradientTape() as gen_tape, tf.GradientTape() as disc_tape:
        generated_images = generator(noise, training=True)

        real_output = discriminator(images, training=True)
        fake_output = discriminator(generated_images, training=True)

        gen_loss = generator_loss(fake_output)
        disc_loss = discriminator_loss(real_output, fake_output)

    gradients_of_generator = gen_tape.gradient(gen_loss,
                                            generator.trainable_variables)
    gradients_of_discriminator = disc_tape.gradient(disc_loss,
                                            discriminator.trainable_variables)
    generator_optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients_of_generator,
                                            generator.trainable_variables))
    discriminator_optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients_of_discriminator,
                                            discriminator.trainable_variables))

    return gen_loss, disc_loss
!ec


Next we define a helper function to produce an output over our training epochs
to see the predictive progression of our generator model. _Note_: I am including
this code here, but comment it out in the training loop.
!bc pycod
def generate_and_save_images(model, epoch, test_input):
    # we're making inferences here
    predictions = model(test_input, training=False)

    fig = plt.figure(figsize=(4, 4))

    for i in range(predictions.shape[0]):
        plt.subplot(4, 4, i+1)
        plt.imshow(predictions[i, :, :, 0] * 127.5 + 127.5, cmap='gray')
        plt.axis('off')

    plt.savefig(f'./images_from_seed_images/image_at_epoch_{str(epoch).zfill(3)}.png')
    plt.close()
    #plt.show()
!ec


!split
===== Checkpoints =====
Setting up checkpoints to periodically save our model during training so that
everything is not lost even if the program were to somehow terminate while
training.

!bc pycod
# Setting up checkpoints to save model during training
checkpoint_dir = './training_checkpoints'
checkpoint_prefix = os.path.join(checkpoint_dir, 'ckpt')
checkpoint = tf.train.Checkpoint(generator_optimizer=generator_optimizer,
                            discriminator_optimizer=discriminator_optimizer,
                            generator=generator,
                            discriminator=discriminator)
!ec

Now we define our training loop

!bc pycod
def train(dataset, epochs):
    generator_loss_list = []
    discriminator_loss_list = []

    for epoch in range(epochs):
        start = time.time()

        for image_batch in dataset:
            gen_loss, disc_loss = train_step(image_batch)
            generator_loss_list.append(gen_loss.numpy())
            discriminator_loss_list.append(disc_loss.numpy())

        #generate_and_save_images(generator, epoch + 1, seed_images)

        if (epoch + 1) % 15 == 0:
            checkpoint.save(file_prefix=checkpoint_prefix)

        print(f'Time for epoch {epoch} is {time.time() - start}')

    #generate_and_save_images(generator, epochs, seed_images)

To train simply call this function. _Warning_: this might take a long time so
there is a folder of a pretrained network already included in the repository.

And here is the result of training our model for 100 epochs

MOVIE: [images_from_seed_images/generation.gif]

Now to avoid having to train and everything, which will take a while depending
on your computer setup we now load in the model which produced the above gif.

!bc pycod
checkpoint.restore(tf.train.latest_checkpoint(checkpoint_dir))
restored_generator = checkpoint.generator
restored_discriminator = checkpoint.discriminator

===== Exploring the Latent Space =====

We have successfully loaded in our latest model. Let us now play around a bit
and see what kind of things we can learn about this model. Our generator takes
an array of 100 numbers. One idea can be to try to systematically change our
input. Let us try and see what we get

!bc pycod
def generate_latent_points(number=100, scale_means=1, scale_stds=1):
    latent_dim = 100
    means = scale_means * tf.linspace(-1, 1, num=latent_dim)
    stds = scale_stds * tf.linspace(-1, 1, num=latent_dim)
    latent_space_value_range = tf.random.normal([number, latent_dim],
                                                means,
                                                stds,
                                                dtype=tf.float64)

    return latent_space_value_range

def generate_images(latent_points):
    # notice we set training to false because we are making inferences
    generated_images = restored_generator.predict(latent_points)

    return generated_images
!ec

!bc pycod
def plot_result(generated_images, number=100):
    # obviously this assumes sqrt number is an int
    fig, axs = plt.subplots(int(np.sqrt(number)), int(np.sqrt(number)),
                            figsize=(10, 10))

    for i in range(int(np.sqrt(number))):
        for j in range(int(np.sqrt(number))):
            axs[i, j].imshow(generated_images[i*j], cmap='Greys')
            axs[i, j].axis('off')

    plt.show()
!ec

!bc pycod
generated_images = generate_images(generate_latent_points())
plot_result(generated_images)
!ec

!split
===== Getting Results =====
We see that the generator generates images that look like MNIST
numbers: $1, 4, 7, 9$. Let's try to tweak it a bit more to see if we are able
to generate a similar plot where we generate every MNIST number. Let us now try
to 'move' a bit around in the latent space. _Note_: decrease the plot number if
these following cells take too long to run on your computer.

!bc pycod
plot_number = 225

generated_images = generate_images(generate_latent_points(number=plot_number,
                                                          scale_means=5,
                                                          scale_stds=1))
plot_result(generated_images, number=plot_number)

generated_images = generate_images(generate_latent_points(number=plot_number,
                                                          scale_means=-5,
                                                          scale_stds=1))
plot_result(generated_images, number=plot_number)

generated_images = generate_images(generate_latent_points(number=plot_number,
                                                          scale_means=1,
                                                          scale_stds=5))
plot_result(generated_images, number=plot_number)
!ec

Again, we have found something interesting. *Moving* around using our means
takes us from digit to digit, while *moving* around using our standard
deviations seem to increase the number of different digits! In the last image
above, we can barely make out every MNIST digit. Let us make on last plot using
this information by upping the standard deviation of our Gaussian noises.

!bc pycod
plot_number = 400
generated_images = generate_images(generate_latent_points(number=plot_number,
                                                          scale_means=1,
                                                          scale_stds=10))
plot_result(generated_images, number=plot_number)
!ec
A pretty cool result! We see that our generator indeed has learned a
distribution which qualitatively looks a whole lot like the MNIST dataset.

!split
===== Interpolating Between MNIST Digits =====
Another interesting way to explore the latent space of our generator model is by
interpolating between the MNIST digits. This section is largely based on
"this excellent blogpost": "https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-interpolate-and-perform-vector-arithmetic-with-faces-using-a-generative-adversarial-network/"
by Jason Brownlee.

So let us start by defining a function to interpolate between two points in the
latent space.

!bc pycod
def interpolation(point_1, point_2, n_steps=10):
    ratios = np.linspace(0, 1, num=n_steps)
    vectors = []
    for i, ratio in enumerate(ratios):
        vectors.append(((1.0 - ratio) * point_1 + ratio * point_2))

    return tf.stack(vectors)
!ec

Now we have all we need to do our interpolation analysis.

!bc pycod
plot_number = 100
latent_points = generate_latent_points(number=plot_number)
results = None
for i in range(0, 2*np.sqrt(plot_number), 2):
    interpolated = interpolation(latent_points[i], latent_points[i+1])
    generated_images = generate_images(interpolated)

    if results is None:
        results = generated_images
    else:
        results = tf.stack((results, generated_images))

plot_results(results, plot_number)
!ec
