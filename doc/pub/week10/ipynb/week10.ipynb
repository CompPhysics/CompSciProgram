    "extrapolation (time series forecasting is just a specific type of\n",
    "extrapolation along the time axis).  This method of data formatting\n",
    "does not use the x data and assumes that the y data are evenly spaced.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a standard machine learning algorithm, the training data has the\n",
    "form of (x,y) so the machine learning algorithm learns to assiciate a\n",
    "y value with a given x value.  This is useful when the test data has x\n",
    "values within the same range as the training data.  However, for this\n",
    "application, the x values of the test data are outside of the x values\n",
    "of the training data and the traditional method of training a machine\n",
    "learning algorithm does not work as well.  For this reason, the\n",
    "recurrent neural network is trained on sequences of y values of the\n",
    "form ((y1, y2), y3), so that the network is concerned with learning\n",
    "the pattern of the y data and not the relation between the x and y\n",
    "data.  As long as the pattern of y data outside of the training region\n",

While the following method can be used to create a data set of any sequence length, the remainder of the code expects the length of sequence to be 2.  This is because the data sets are very small and the higher the lenght of the sequence the less resulting data points. -->"
