    "## Building convolutional neural networks in Tensorflow and Keras\n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed earlier, CNNs are neural networks built from the assumption that the inputs\n",
    "to the network are 2D images. This is important because the number of features or pixels in images\n",
    "grows very fast with the image size, and an enormous number of weights and biases are needed in order to build an accurate network.  \n",
    "\n",
    "As before, we still have our input, a hidden layer and an output. What's novel about convolutional networks\n",
    "are the **convolutional** and **pooling** layers stacked in pairs between the input and the hidden layer.\n",
    "In addition, the data is no longer represented as a 2D feature matrix, instead each input is a number of 2D\n",
