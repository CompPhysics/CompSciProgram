    "## Regression analysis, overarching aims\n",
    "\n",
    "Regression modeling deals with the description of  the sampling distribution of a given random variable $y$ and how it varies as function of another variable or a set of such variables $\\boldsymbol{x} =[x_0, x_1,\\dots, x_{n-1}]^T$. \n",
    "The first variable is called the **dependent**, the **outcome** or the **response** variable while the set of variables $\\boldsymbol{x}$ is called the independent variable, or the predictor variable or the explanatory variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "A regression model aims at finding a likelihood function $p(\\boldsymbol{y}\\vert \\boldsymbol{x})$, that is the conditional distribution for $\\boldsymbol{y}$ with a given $\\boldsymbol{x}$. The estimation of  $p(\\boldsymbol{y}\\vert \\boldsymbol{x})$ is made using a data set with \n",
    "* $n$ cases $i = 0, 1, 2, \\dots, n-1$ \n",
    "\n",
    "* Response (target, dependent or outcome) variable $y_i$ with $i = 0, 1, 2, \\dots, n-1$ \n",
    "\n",
    "* $p$ so-called explanatory (independent or predictor) variables $\\boldsymbol{x}_i=[x_{i0}, x_{i1}, \\dots, x_{ip-1}]$ with $i = 0, 1, 2, \\dots, n-1$ and explanatory variables running from $0$ to $p-1$. See below for more explicit examples.   \n",
    "\n",
    " The goal of the regression analysis is to extract/exploit relationship between $\\boldsymbol{y}$ and $\\boldsymbol{x}$ in or to infer causal dependencies, approximations to the likelihood functions, functional relationships and to make predictions, making fits and many other things.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Regression analysis, overarching aims II\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider an experiment in which $p$ characteristics of $n$ samples are\n",
    "measured. The data from this experiment, for various explanatory variables $p$ are normally represented by a matrix  \n",
    "$\\mathbf{X}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The matrix $\\mathbf{X}$ is called the *design\n",
    "matrix*. Additional information of the samples is available in the\n",
    "form of $\\boldsymbol{y}$ (also as above). The variable $\\boldsymbol{y}$ is\n",
    "generally referred to as the *response variable*. The aim of\n",
    "regression analysis is to explain $\\boldsymbol{y}$ in terms of\n",
    "$\\boldsymbol{X}$ through a functional relationship like $y_i =\n",
    "f(\\mathbf{X}_{i,\\ast})$. When no prior knowledge on the form of\n",
    "$f(\\cdot)$ is available, it is common to assume a linear relationship\n",
    "between $\\boldsymbol{X}$ and $\\boldsymbol{y}$. This assumption gives rise to\n",
    "the *linear regression model* where $\\boldsymbol{\\beta} = [\\beta_0, \\ldots,\n",
    "\\beta_{p-1}]^{T}$ are the *regression parameters*. \n",
    "\n",
    "Linear regression gives us a set of analytical equations for the parameters $\\beta_j$.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Examples\n",
    "In order to understand the relation among the predictors $p$, the set of data $n$ and the target (outcome, output etc) $\\boldsymbol{y}$,\n",
    "consider the model we discussed for describing nuclear binding energies. \n",

We could think of these data as a result of an experiment or a complicated numerical experiment. These data are functions of a series of variables $\\boldsymbol{x}=[x_0,x_1,\\dots,x_{n-1}]$, that is $y_i = y(x_i)$ with $i=0,1,2,\\dots,n-1$. The variables $x_i$ could represent physical quantities like time, temperature, position etc. We assume that $y(x)$ is a smooth function. \n",

    "Since obtaining these data points may not be trivial, we want to use these data to fit a function which can allow us to make predictions for values of $y$ which are not in the present set.

    "not met so many cases where we are too sensitive to the scaling of our\n",
    "data. Normally the data may need a rescaling and/or may be sensitive\n",
    "to extreme values. Scaling the data renders our inputs much more\n",
    "suitable for the algorithms we want to employ.\n",
    "\n",
    "For data sets gathered for real world applications, it is rather normal that\n",

    "## Functionality in Scikit-Learn\n",

    "**Scikit-Learn** has several functions which allow us to rescale the\n",
    "data, normally resulting in much better results in terms of various\n",
    "accuracy scores.  The **StandardScaler** function in **Scikit-Learn**\n",
    "ensures that for each feature/predictor we study the mean value is\n",
    "zero and the variance is one (every column in the design/feature\n",
    "matrix).  This scaling has the drawback that it does not ensure that\n",
    "we have a particular maximum or minimum in our data set. Another\n",
    "function included in **Scikit-Learn** is the **MinMaxScaler** which\n",
    "ensures that all features are exactly between $0$ and $1$. The\n",
    "\n",
    "## More preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Normalizer** scales each data\n",
    "point such that the feature vector has a euclidean length of one. In other words, it\n",
    "projects a data point on the circle (or sphere in the case of higher dimensions) with a\n",
    "radius of 1. This means every data point is scaled by a different number (by the\n",
    "inverse of it’s length).\n",
    "This normalization is often used when only the direction (or angle) of the data matters,\n",
    "not the length of the feature vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **RobustScaler** works similarly to the StandardScaler in that it\n",
    "ensures statistical properties for each feature that guarantee that\n",
    "they are on the same scale. However, the RobustScaler uses the median\n",
    "and quartiles, instead of mean and variance. This makes the\n",
    "RobustScaler ignore data points that are very different from the rest\n",
