    "## Preprocessing our data\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we proceed however, we will discuss how to preprocess our\n",
    "data. Till now and in connection with our previous examples we have\n",
    "not met so many cases where we are too sensitive to the scaling of our\n",
    "data. Normally the data may need a rescaling and/or may be sensitive\n",
    "to extreme values. Scaling the data renders our inputs much more\n",
    "suitable for the algorithms we want to employ.\n",
    "\n",
    "For data sets gathered for real world applications, it is rather normal that\n",
    "different features have very different units and\n",
    "numerical scales. For example, a data set detailing health habits may include\n",
    "features such as **age** in the range $0-80$, and **caloric intake** of order $2000$.\n",
    "Many machine learning methods sensitive to the scales of the features and may perform poorly if they\n",
    "are very different scales. Therefore, it is typical to scale\n",
    "the features in a way to avoid such outlier values.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Functionality in Scikit-Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scikit-Learn** has several functions which allow us to rescale the\n",
    "data, normally resulting in much better results in terms of various\n",
    "accuracy scores.  The **StandardScaler** function in **Scikit-Learn**\n",
    "ensures that for each feature/predictor we study the mean value is\n",
    "zero and the variance is one (every column in the design/feature\n",
    "matrix).  This scaling has the drawback that it does not ensure that\n",
    "we have a particular maximum or minimum in our data set. Another\n",
    "function included in **Scikit-Learn** is the **MinMaxScaler** which\n",
    "ensures that all features are exactly between $0$ and $1$. The\n",
    "\n",
    "## More preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Normalizer** scales each data\n",
    "point such that the feature vector has a euclidean length of one. In other words, it\n",
    "projects a data point on the circle (or sphere in the case of higher dimensions) with a\n",
    "radius of 1. This means every data point is scaled by a different number (by the\n",
    "inverse of it’s length).\n",
    "This normalization is often used when only the direction (or angle) of the data matters,\n",
    "not the length of the feature vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **RobustScaler** works similarly to the StandardScaler in that it\n",
    "ensures statistical properties for each feature that guarantee that\n",
    "they are on the same scale. However, the RobustScaler uses the median\n",
    "and quartiles, instead of mean and variance. This makes the\n",
    "RobustScaler ignore data points that are very different from the rest\n",
    "(like measurement errors). These odd data points are also called\n",
    "outliers, and might often lead to trouble for other scaling\n",
    "techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Frequently used scaling functions\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Many features are often scaled using standardization to improve performance. In **Scikit-Learn** this is given by the **StandardScaler** function as discussed above. It is easy however to write your own. \n",
    "Mathematically, this involves subtracting the mean and divide by the standard deviation over the data set, for each feature:"

    "When you are comparing your own code with for example **Scikit-Learn**'s\n",
    "library, there are some technicalities to keep in mind.  The examples\n",
    "here demonstrate some of these aspects with potential pitfalls.\n",
    "\n",
    "The discussion here focuses on the role of the intercept, how we can\n",
    "set up the design matrix, what scaling we should use and other topics\n",
    "which tend  confuse us.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The intercept can be interpreted as the expected value of our\n",
    "target/output variables when all other predictors are set to zero.\n",
    "Thus, if we cannot assume that the expected outputs/targets are zero\n",
    "when all predictors are zero (the columns in the design matrix), it\n",
    "may be a bad idea to implement a model which penalizes the intercept.\n",
    "Furthermore, in for example Ridge and Lasso regression, the default solutions\n",
    "from the library **Scikit-Learn** (when not shrinking $\\beta_0$) for the unknown parameters\n",
    "$\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$, are derived under the assumption that both $\\boldsymbol{y}$ and\n",
    "$\\boldsymbol{X}$ are zero centered, that is we subtract the mean values.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## More thinking\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If our predictors represent different scales, then it is important to\n",
    "standardize the design matrix $\\boldsymbol{X}$ by subtracting the mean of each\n",
    "column from the corresponding column and dividing the column with its\n",

    "have been studying in our various examples, the data are in many cases\n",
    "already scaled and there is no need to scale them. You as a user of different machine learning algorithms, should always perform  a\n",
    "survey of your data, with a critical assessment of them in case you need to scale the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you need to scale the data, not doing so will give an *unfair*\n",
    "penalization of the parameters since their magnitude depends on the\n",
    "scale of their corresponding predictor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose as an example that you \n",
    "you have an input variable given by the heights of different persons.\n",
    "Human height might be measured in inches or meters or\n",
    "kilometers. If measured in kilometers, a standard linear regression\n",
    "model with this predictor would probably give a much bigger\n",
    "coefficient term, than if measured in millimeters.\n",
    "This can clearly lead to problems in evaluating the cost/loss functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Still thinking\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind that when you transform your data set before training a model, the same transformation needs to be done\n",
