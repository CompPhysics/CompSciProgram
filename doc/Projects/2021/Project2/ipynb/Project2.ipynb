    "## Defining the data sets to analyze yourself\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project , you can propose own data sets that relate to your research interests or just use existing data sets from say\n",
    "1. [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) \n",
    "\n",
    "2. The [University of California at Irvine (UCI) with its  machine learning repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Or other sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "The approach to the analysis of these new data sets should follow to a large extent what you did in project 1. That is:\n",
    "1. Whether you end up with a regression or a classification problem, you should employ at least two of the methods we have discussed among **linear regression (including Ridge and Lasso)**, **Logistic Regression**, **Neural Networks**, **Convolution Neural Networks**, **Recurrent Neural Networks**, **Adversarial Neural Networks**, **Support Vector Machines** and **Decision Trees, Random Forests, Bagging and Boosting**. You could for example explore  all of the approaches from decision trees, via bagging and voting classifiers, to random forests, boosting and finally XGboost. If you wish to venture into **convolutional neural networks** or **recurrent neural networks**, or extensions of neural networkds, feel free to do so. You can also study unsupervised methods, although we have mainly paid attendtion to supervised learning. The methods we have explored as **Principal Component Analysis** and **k-means Clustering**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For Boosting, feel also free to write your own codes.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The estimates you used and tested in project 1 should also be included, that is the $R2$-score, **MSE**, confusion matrix, accuracy score, information gain,  ROC and Cumulative gains curves and other, cross-validation and/or bootstrap if these are relevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Similarly, feel free to explore various activations functions in deep learning and various approachs to stochastic gradient descent approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. If possible, you should link the data sets with existing research and analyses thereof. Scientific articles which have used Machine Learning algorithms to analyze the data are highly welcome. Perhaps you can improve previous analyses and even publish a new article? \n",
    "\n",
    "4. A critical assessment of the methods with ditto perspectives and recommendations is also something you need to include.\n",
    "\n",
    "All in all, the report should follow the same pattern as the two previous ones, with abstract, introduction, methods, code, results, conclusions etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "We propose also an alternative to the above. This is a project on using machine learning methods (neural networks mainly) to the solution of ordinary differential equations and partial differential equations, with a final twist on how to diagonalize a symmetric matrix with neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a field with a large interest recently, spanning from studies of turbulence in fluid mechanics and meteorology to the solution of quantum mechanical systems. As reading background you may find the textbook by [Yadav et al](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9789401798150) useful."

    "  * Try to evaluate the reliabilty and numerical stability/precision of your results. If possible, include a qualitative and/or quantitative discussion of the numerical stability, eventual loss of precision etc.\n",

    "  * Try to give an interpretation of you results in your answers to  the problems.\n",

We wish to keep this course at the interactive level and your comments can help us improve it.\n",

You may find such a logbook very handy at later stages in your work, especially when you don't properly remember  what a previous test version  of your program did. Here you could also record  the time spent on solving the exercise, various algorithms you may have tested or other topics which you feel worthy of mentioning."
