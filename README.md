# CompSciProgram
This repository contains exercises and projects on computational science and AI for the CompSci program

## First project:

Machine learning with linear and non-linear regression, logistic
regression and support vector machines as well as Bayesian linear
regression. This involves linear algebra (matrix inversion,
determinants, eigenvalues, SVD and more from FYS4150), convex
optimization problem (gradient descent, steepest descent, stochastic
gradient descent,  iterative solvers) and several central
(deterministic) ML methods. Calculation-oriented statistics with
Bayes' theorem and MCMC sampling can  also be included. Bayesian linear
regression can be omitted.

### Workload: 6 ECTS.
Datasets you study can be adapted to your research field, whether it
is astro, physics, chemistry, bioscience, geoscience or mathematics.
Planned finished end January  2023


## Second project:

Deep learning: standard neural networks, convolution and neural
networks (CNN), recursive neural networks, Boltzmann machines, various autoencoders and possibly general adversial networks. Reduction
of dimensionality in scientific problems. Possible topic to work with:
solution of ordinary and partial differential equations. Here we can
take this from a deep learning perspective and a traditional final
difference form taught in FYS4150. But we can also focus on classification problems.
Datasets can again be adapted to the field.

### Workload: 7 ECTS.  Planned finished end March/begin April  2023


## Third project:

Three possible alternative paths that combine elements from both courses.
-Unsupervised learning: PCA, other dimensionality reduction methods and clustering, k-means or similar methods. 
-Bayesian machine learning: brings in MCMC, statistics and deep learning.
-Quantum machine learning: Boltzmann machines, classical and quantum machines. MCMC simulations, gradient methods.
-Or simulate data and themes related to own research or other user defined topics.

### Workload: 7 ECTS.  Planned finished end May/begin June 2023

In total 20 ECTS.
